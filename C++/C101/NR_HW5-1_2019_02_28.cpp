// Source code: NR_HW5-1_2019-02-28.cpp
// User enters characters, one at a time. The program records what types of characters are entered, and for each one, displays its ASCII code and the next two characters on the ASCII table. When the user enters a pound (#) symbol, the program displays the total number of characters entered, by type.
