/* Example output

Enter a number between 1 and 100, please: 1
This number is ODD.
The sum of all positive integers from 1 to 1 is 1.

Enter a number between 1 and 100, please: 2
This number is EVEN.
The sum of all positive integers from 1 to 2 is 3.

Enter a number between 1 and 100, please: 17
This number is ODD.
The sum of all positive integers from 1 to 17 is 153.

Enter a number between 1 and 100, please: 100
This number is EVEN.
The sum of all positive integers from 1 to 100 is 5050.

Enter a number between 1 and 100, please: 101

Goodbye!
