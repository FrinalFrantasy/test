* Silence
I enjoyed the book a lot, although perhaps "enjoy" isn't precisely the word I mean. Perhaps I should say instead that I got a lot out of it. It's a book that's been on my to-read list for a long time, and has been recommended to me several times, but because it's a translation, and because it's set in both a time and place unfamiliar to me, I'd assumed that the book would be fairly difficult to follow, or even understand at all. Happily, this was not the case, and I found that, technically speaking, it was a relatively easy read.

From early on in the novel, I found it difficult to understand why Rodrigues seemed to read Christ's words, "What thou dost, do quickly", in such a negative light; he seems to read them as "Get away from me". This necessitates his revelation, at the end of the book, that Christ's real meaning in those words was "Do this quickly, because you are in pain, and I want you to be done with this burden". Whereas, my interpretation of those words of Christ has generally been something like "Do this quickly, because I am in pain, and I want to be done with this burden." Considering the enormous importance the meaning of these words has to the story, I'd be interested in knowing what the standard interpretation of them was by the Catholic church of that era (as well as by the modern day church).

The aspect of Rodrigues which stood out to me most strongly was his preoccupation with images, or with initial impressions, or with a certain kind of simple evaluation of things, an evaluation which had as its end the placing of things (especially people) into one of a small number of relatively simple categories. I forget where, but there's a place in the novel where he outright says, in one of his letters, that people come in two categories; categories which essentially amount to "good" and "bad". Kichijiro is the prime example of a person who placed quickly and firmly in the "bad" category (more on Kichijiro in a moment). Additionally, you have his preconceived notion of his own martyrdom - what it will look like, and how heroic it will be. Finally, you have his obsession with the face of Christ.

That is another difference between Rodrigues and myself; whereas Rodrigues thinks (at least for most of the of the novel) of Christ's face as absolutely beautiful, I have always taken the words of Isaiah to mean that Christ the man was, to put it simply, average looking, or even less-than-average looking (Isaiah 53: 2b - "He has no stately form or majesty / That we should look upon Him, / Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him."). Of course, the face of God in Heaven, or the face of Christ as described in Revelations (1:14-15), is a different matter; but if I recall correctly, Rodrigues' impression of Christ's face is made with specific reference to the human body of Christ. Anyway; Rodrigues writes and thinks of the face of Christ in such strong terms, and with such near-obsession, that it led me to wonder whether his faith would be shaken by the idea of an average looking Christ.

Likewise, since, as I said, my strongest impression of Rodrigues (or at least, my strongest negative impression of him - on the positive side of things, he seems like a fine priest and a pleasant fellow) was of his preoccupation with images and first impressions. Because of this, I quickly began to suspect that much of his epiphany at the novel's climax would have to do with a realization that images can be misleading, and first impressions can fail to speak the real truth of a thing. This brings me back to Kichijiro. Because while Rodrigues was quick to sort Kichijiro into the category of "bad" or "weak" or "cowardly" people, I felt that the novel hinted from pretty early on that Kichijiro should not be dismissed so quickly. As the novel progressed, Kichijiro's significance only grew, and as he vacillated between betraying his friends and faith, and coming back to Rodrigues in repentance, I began to feel a kinship with him. For, although my sinful nature prohibits me from being placed in the "good" category, I also am loathe to believe that I ought to be permanently left in the "bad" category to rot. Rather, I, like Kichijiro, am continually falling into depravity, continually facing my own wretched state, and continually crawling back to God for forgiveness.
