59 seconds notes

HAPPINESS - WRITING

Don't try to block out negative thoughts; focus on positive thoughts, instead.

When dealing with loss, tragedy, or any event that causes you a great deal of suffering, talking about it doesn't help much, but what does help is spending a few minutes each day writing down your innermost feelings about it.

Once a week, write down five (for instance) things for which you are grateful. (Or maybe one per day?)

Spend a few minutes each day (?) writing down your ideal future. Be realistic, but imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could, and you've achieved all your goals.
Similarly, spend a few minutes each day (?) writing down the most wonderful experience of your life.
Similarly, think about someone you love, and spend 20 minutes writing about why this person means so much to you.

Mon: Write down three things for which you are greatful.
Tue: Think back to a happy memory. Spend a few minutes writing it down, describing it.
Wed: Imagine and write down a very happy future, where everything has gone right for you.
Thu: Write a short letter to someone meaningful to you, telling them why they're meaningful, why you love them, etc.
Fri: Write down three things from the previous week that went well for you.

(Alternate formulation, from some site: "Write down three things that went well each day and their causes every night for one week. In addition, provide a causal explanation for each good thing.")

HAPPINESS - PURCHASES

Buy experiences, not goods
Spend money on other people

HAPPINESS - OTHER

Smile. Smile for 15-30 seconds. Try to make it especially genuine by thinking of something that makes you smile naturally.

Sit up straight. Don't slouch. (posture)

Act happy.

Seek novelty.



PERSUASION - INTERVIEWS

Likeability is a bigger factor than qualifications or experience.
    -find something you truly like about the organization, and let your opinion be known
    -feel free to give a genuine compliment to the interviewer
    -chat about a non-job-related topic that you and the interviewer find interesting
    -show interest in the interviewer. Ask what type of person is being sought and how the position fits into the overall organization
    -be enthusiastic about the position and the organization
    -smile and maintain eye contact with the interviewer

When interviewing (or in other contexts?), mention weaknesses and flaws early, not late.
Contrariwise, mention special strengths, good qualities, late.

If you make a blunder, a social faux paux, acknowledge it if necessary, then continue on as if nothing had happened.

When choosing your seat at a table or in a room, aim for the middle.

When thinking about the name of a new project, campaign, or product, K.I.S.S. Aim for something pronouncable and not crazy hard to spell.

(unrelated?) Always use the the simplest available language.



PERSUASION - FAVORS, PRATFALLS, AND GOSSIP - LIKEABILITY

To increase your own likeability, develop a genuine interest in others.

Little things:
    -give sincere compliments
    -match other people's body language and style of speech
    -try to be modest
    -be generous with your time, resources, and skill

If you want to gain someone's trust or a big favor, first ask them for a small favor.

If there's a danger of you being seen as too perfect (maybe inhuman), then make some kind of small mistake or act of clumsiness to offset that effect.

Gossip about the positive traits of others, rather than the negative.

People are more fond of things that they are introduced to while eating a meal.

Statements which are pithy or rhyming tend to be more persuasive.



PERSUASION - MISC

To bypass the bystander effect, focus on one individual when asking for help.

When sending an email to many people, send it (if possible) as many individual emails rather than one group email.

To get a stranger to like you and/or to do you a favor, first do them a small, thoughtful (moreso than useful) favor.



MOTIVATION

Journal to complete when attempting to achieve a new goal or otherwise change your life:
    1. What is your overall goal?
    2. Break your overall goal into a maximum of five smaller steps. Each step should be associated with a goal that is concrete, measurable, realistic, and time-based. For each sub-goal...
        2.1 My sub-goal is to...
        2.2 I believe that I can achieve this goal because...
        2.3 To achieve this sub-goal, I will...
        2.4 This will be achieved by the following date:
        2.5 My reward for achieving this will be...
        etc.
    3. What are the benefits of achieving your overall goal? List three important benefits, focusing on how much better life will be for you and those around you.
    4. Tell someone about your goal. Make it public somehow. [conflict with Talent Code guy, keeping goals secret?]

To defeat procrastination, work on a daunting task for just 5 minutes.

Don't spend time visualizing/imagining yourself as successful, but do spend time visualizing/imagining yourself practicing.
    Also, this visulization should be done from a third-person perspective.

A technique to "motivate you to achieve your goals and persevere in the face of difficlties":
    1. What is your goal?
    2. Portential benefits and setbacks:
        2.1 Write down one word that would reflect an important way in which your life would be better if you achieved your goal.
        2.2 Write down one word that would reflect a significant barrier that stands in the way of achieving your goal.
        2.3 Repeat 2.1
        2.4 Repeat 2.2
    3. Elaborate your answer to 2.1. Imagine all the benefits that would flow from this achievement.
    4. Elaborate your answer to 2.2. Imagine how the obstacle hinders achievement and the steps that you would take to deal with it.
    etc.

When thinking of not doing something, imagine how much you will regret not doing the thing.



DIETING AND DRINKING

To eat less at a meal, start by eating at your normal speed, then partway through switch to eating at half-speed.

Put problem snack food out of reach, out of sight, etc.

Focus on your food. Distractions tend to increase how much you eat.



CREATIVITY

To increase productivity, work in an area where you can observe real plants (either inside or through the window).

Decorate with images that showcase individuality or uniqueness.

If you're stuck on a problem, move your body around. Run, climb something, or even just lie down.



MISC

To get people to react a certain way to you or an idea that you're presenting to them, put them in a situation where they're going to have that reaction anyway. For instance, if you want to be exciting to someone, meet with them in a situation that will be exciting regardless. Association.

To get people to like you, start by disagreeing with them, then switch to agreeing.

Slow smiles are more attractive.

An exercise for getting closer to your SO:
    Day 1: Spend ten minutes writing about your deepest feelings about your SO. Feel free to explore your emotions and thoughts.
    Day 2: Think about someone that you know who is in a relationship that is in some way inferior to your own. Write down three important reasons why your relationship is better than theirs.
    Day 3: Write one important positive quality that your partner has, and explain why this quality means so much to you.

Work in the presence of something that reminds you of your SO.

Detecting lies. When people lie, they tend to become more static, cut down on gestures; listen for a decrease in detail, an increase in pauses. Avoidance of the words "me" "mine" "I", and increase of "him" and "her".
    If you're interested in detecting if someone's lying or being evasive, first ask them some questions that are likely to get honest answers, and pay attention to the person's affect. Then ask the more sensitive question(s) and compare their affects.

Estimating time: break the activity into its constituent parts and estimate the time for each one and add together. (This helps avoid the planning fallacy.)



STRESS

When you experience an event that has the potential to make you feel angry... spend a few moments thinking about the positive aspects of the event. Write down how you (may?) have benefited from the experience and how your life is better as a result of what happened. Do not withhold anything and be as honest as possible.

Praying for other people reduces your own stress.



DECISION MAKING

Watch out for persuasion techniques!

When making a difficult decision, especially one that's resistent to pro-and-con lists (such as, which picture do I like better?), take a quick look at the all the options, then do something to occupy your mind for five minutes (like a puzzle), then look once more at the options, and pick what feels right.

Err on the side of accepting new opportunities and challenges. We more often regret what we didn't do than what we did.



PARENTING

Marshmallow test
    Offer the child 1 marshmallow now, or 2 marshmallow in 10 minutes.

Reverse "touch your head" and "touch your toes" game.
    10 questions
    2 points for correct answer
    1 point for almost giving a wrong answer, then switching to a right one
    0 points for a wrong answer
    3-year-olds get about 3
    4-year-olds get about 10
    5-year-olds get about 14

freeze game
    dance fast to fast music, slow to slow; then switch
    play music when you wave a baton, stop when you stop; then switch

** Little Book of Talent

Talent Code notes


It is beneficial to (literally) stare at your idols, e.g., people who are good at the thing you want to be good at. Watch them work, imagine yourself in their place. Pictures are good, video is better. (Unsure the best way to apply this to writing. Quotes?)

Steal. Do what works. Look at the difference between your process/performance and that of masters.

Try new things; push yourself; even if it may cause you to fail (short term).

Simplify and spartan-ify the practice space.

Identify hard skills vs soft skills.
Hard skills
    ABC: Always Be Consistent
    Be precise and measured. Go slowly. Make one simple move at a time, repeating and perfecting it before you move on. Pay attention to erros, and fix them, particularly at the start.
    Always do the basic practices, even when you're advanced.
Soft skills
    RRR: Reading, Recognizing, Reaction
    Soft skills are built by playing and exploring inside challenging, ever-changing environments.
    Experiment and make mistakes.
    Focus on making a high number of varied reps, and on getting clear feedback.
Mixed skills
    Prioritize teh hard skills because in the long run they're more important to your talent.

Seeking a mentor
    1. Avoid someone who reminds you of a curteous waiter
    2. Seek someone who scares you a little
    3. Seek someone who gives short, clear instructions
    4. Seek someone who loves teaching fundamentals
    5. Other things being equal, pick the older person

Try to stay in sweet spot. Mark the boundry of your curent ability, then aim a little beyond it:
Comfort zone
    Sensations: Ease, effortlessness. You're working, but not reaching or struggling.
    Percentage of successful attempts: 80+
Sweet spot
    Sensations: Frustration, difficulty, alertness to errors. You're fully engaged in an ointense struggle - as if you're stretching with all your might for a nearly unreachable goal, brushing it with your fingertips, then reaching again.
    Percentage of successful attempts: 50-80
Survival zone
    Sensations: Confusion, desperation. You're overmatched: scrambling, thrashing, and guessing. You guess right sometimes, but it's mostly luck.
    Percentage of successful attempts: <50

Measure practice by "reaches", reps, and quality reps, not by total time spent.

Break every move down into chunks.
    1. What is the smallest single element of this skill that I can master?
    2. What other chunks link to that chunk?

practice sequential chunks out of sequence.

Seek a daily SAP: Smallest Achievable Perfection. aka a single perfect(able) chunk.

Embrace struggle

Choose five minutes a day over an hour a week

Practice is, itself, a skill. It can be learned, improved.

Don't do "drills". Instead, play small, addictive games.
The governing principle is this: if it can be counted, it can be turned into a game.
Try something. Get a point for each successful attempt. Etc.
Related(?): invent daily tests for yourself
Related(?): rather than "do X 20 times", try "do X perfectly 5 times in a row"

practice space:
Practice alone.

Use mnemomnics to memorize things.

Pay attention immediately after you make a mistake.
Visualize your brain using the information gained from a mistake to increase the number of correct connections.
Pay attention also immediately after you finally get something right.

practice space:
Shrink the practice space (literally or figuratively). Find the minimum space needed to make the appropriate reaches and reps.

Practice very, very slowly.

Practice with your eyes closed (if at all possible).

Take naps.

To learn a new move, exaggerate it.

Focus on the success you want to achieve, rather than the failure you're trying to avoid.

When trying to learn written material, read it once and then try to re-write it (or a summary of the salient points). (Then read it again to see what you got wrong?)

Use the sandwich technique to isolate and get rid of mistakes. When dealing with a mistake...
    1. Make the correct move.
    2. Make the incorrect move.
    3. Make the correct move again.

To choose the best practice method, use the REPS method
    R: Reaching and Repeating
        Does the practice have you operating on the edge of your ability, reaching and repeating?
    E: Engagement
        Is the practice immersive? Does it command your attention? Does it use emotion to propel you toward a goal?
    P: Purposefulness
        Does the task directly connect to the skill you want to build?
    S: Strong, Speedy Feedback
        Does the learner receive a stream of accurate information about his performance - where he succeeded and where he made mistakes?

Stop (practising) before you're exhuasted

When possible, practice immediately after a performance

In bed, just before going to sleep, play a mental movie of an idealized performance.

End practice sessions on a positive note.

Tips for coaching
    1. Use the first few seconds to connect on an emotional level
    2. Avoid giving long speeches - instead, deliver vivid chunks of information
    3. Do not use imprecise language
    4. Make a scorecard for learning
    5. Maximize "reachfulness"
    6. Aim to create independent learners

Embrace repetition

Instead of trying to "break" a bad habit, develop a good habit which overrides it

To learn something more deeply, teach it

When you hit a plateu, modify your practice.
    Go slower, faster, or backwards, for instance

Keep your big goals secret

Think like a gardener, work like a carpenter.
    Think patiently, without judgment.
    Work steadily, strategically, knowing that each piece connects to a larger whole.








When actually doing a task, just start. Just start.
Consider using the pomodoro technique.

You have to solve problems yourself. It's not enough to know, theoretically, how to do something; you must actually do it.

If something seems daunting, skim first. Look at chapter titles, illustrations, etc. Get a general lay of the land. (Maybe do so afterwards, as well?)

First read (maybe after skimming?), then try to write down what you read (or apply it; as applicable; the point is, test yourself), THEN re-read.

Mix up problems. Interleave.





Researchers showed that writing your daily list the evening before helps you accomplish them the next day. If you don't write them down, they will take the valuable slots of memory.
Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time.
Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it's only one pomodoro.
Take notes about what works and what doesn't.
Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.

Focus on process rather than product.

Explain things to other people to understand them better.
Seek criticism from other people.x=

ANXIETY
    -Chew gum when you're approaching a situation that would make you nervous like public speaking or bungee jumping. I can't remember where I heard it but apparently if we are 'eating' something in our brains trip and it reasons 'I would not be eating if I were danger. So I'm not in danger'. Has helped calm me a few times.

BRAINSTORMING / PROBLEM-SOLVING
    -If you're not solving a problem, especially if you're making zero progress but it's not apparent you're missing anything, step away from the problem for at least 1 hour (preferably a day).
    -Write down AT LEAST 10 ideas, no matter how stupid.
    -If you're stuck on a problem, move your body around. Run, climb something, or even just lie down.

COMPETITION
    -If you're playing beer pong and your opponent is playing like he sold his soul to the Devil, all you have to do is ask what he is doing to with his opposite throwing hand.
    "Damn bro you're playing hella good! What are you doing with your left hand when you shoot?"

GETTING THINGS DONE / EXECUTIVE ACTION
    -When actually doing a task, just start. Just start.
    -Consider using the pomodoro technique.
    -plan it all in advance, in detail
    -"Fortunately, there is a category of strategic self-statements that can overcome these problems pre-suasively. The statements have various names in scholarly usage, but I'm going to call them IF/WHEN-THEN PLANS. They are designed to help us achieve a goal by readying us (1) to register certain cues in settings where we can further our goal, and (2) to take an appropriate action spurred by the cues and consistent with the goal. Let's say that we aim to lose weight. An if/when-then plan might be "IF/WHEN, after my business lunches, the server asks if I'd like to have dessert, THEN I will order mint tea."
    -Set rules for yourself so you can automate as much decision-making as possible.
    -Don't postpone decisions or open "loops" just to avoid uncomfortable conversations.
    -Learn to make non-fatal or reversible decisions as quickly as possible.
    -Set time limits, option limits, or finance thresholds.
    -Don't strive for variation - and thus increase option consideration - when it's not needed. Routine enables innovation where it's most valuable.
    -To defeat procrastination, work on a daunting task for just 5 minutes.
    -When thinking of not doing something, imagine how much you will regret not doing the thing.
    -When actually doing a task, just start. Just start.

    -Don't try to block out negative thoughts; focus on positive thoughts, instead.

MANTRAS
    -Debt first
    -Am I ready for the next thing I'm going to do today?

MARKETING
    -When thinking about the name of a new project, campaign, or product, K.I.S.S. Aim for something pronouncable and not crazy hard to spell.

MARRIAGE
    -Work in the presence of something that reminds you of your spouse.
    -Pray for your spouse. (helps prevents cheating)
    -Spend ten minutes writing about your deepest feelings about your SO. Feel free to explore your emotions and thoughts.
    -Write one important positive quality that your partner has, and explain why this quality means so much to you.

MEETINGS
    -If you're in a group meeting and you suspect that someone in there might come after you about something, sit right next to them. They were hoping that the group would provide some sort of herd defense, but if you're right next to them it can't be anything other than personal. This tends to make them back off, or at least substantially temper what they say.

MEETING PEOPLE
    -Before meeting people, adopt a confident stance.
    -When you first meet people try to notice their eye colour while also smiling at them. It might be because you look for a second or two longer, but all I can tell you is that people really respond to it.
    -If you get yourself to be really happy and excited to see other people, they will react the same to you. It doesn't always happen the first time, but it will definitely happen next time.

META
    -Take notes about what works and what doesn't.

    -To get people to react a certain way to you or an idea that you're presenting to them, put them in a situation where they're going to have that reaction anyway. For instance, if you want to be exciting to someone, meet with them in a situation that will be exciting regardless. Association.
    -To get people to like you, start by disagreeing with them, then switch to agreeing.
    -Slow smiles are more attractive.
    -When people lie, they tend to become more static, cut down on gestures; listen for a decrease in detail, an increase in pauses. Avoidance of the words "me" "mine" "I", and increase of "him" and "her".
    -If you're interested in detecting if someone's lying or being evasive, first ask them some questions that are likely to get honest answers, and pay attention to the person's affect. Then ask the more sensitive question(s) and compare their affects.
    -from Dale Carnegie:
        -Avoid argumentation.
        -Never say "you're wrong".

PERSUASION - ATTRACTION
    -be confident
    -be fit (exercise 1 hour, 3 times a week)
    -dress well
    -practice good hygiene

PERSUASION - INTERVIEWS
    -Likeability is a bigger factor than qualifications or experience.
        -find something you truly like about the organization, and let your opinion be known
        -feel free to give a genuine compliment to the interviewer
        -chat about a non-job-related topic that you and the interviewer find interesting

        -be enthusiastic about the position and the organization
        -smile and maintain eye contact with the interviewer
    -When interviewing (or in other contexts?), mention weaknesses and flaws early, not late.
    -Contrariwise, mention special strengths, good qualities, late.
    -If you make a blunder, a social faux paux, acknowledge it if necessary, then continue on as if nothing had happened.
    -For interviews I recommend altering your psychological state beforehand. Tell yourself "I've known these people all my life. We're old friends catching up. I can't wait to see them". Visualize the experience, shaking hands, making eye contact, having conversation. What things can you not to wait to tell them? Hold an open pose...stand with your legs apart, hands on your hips, and shoulders back while doing this and SMILE. This may sound cliche but you are in charge of your own psychological state and the power of suggestion is strong.

PERSUASION - LIKEABILITY
    -Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.
    -Give honest and sincere appreciationg.
    -Arouse in the other person an eager want.
    -Smile.
    -Become genuinely interested in other people.
    -Use a person's name
    -Encourage others to talk about themselves.
    -Make the other person feel important.
    -Talk in terms of the other person's interest.

PLANNING
    -Focus on the success you want to achieve, rather than the failure you're trying to avoid.
    -Estimating time: break the activity into its constituent parts and estimate the time for each one and add together. (This helps avoid the planning fallacy.)
    -A technique to "motivate you to achieve your goals and persevere in the face of difficlties":
        -1. What is your goal?
        -2. Portential benefits and setbacks:
            -2.1 Write down one word that would reflect an important way in which your life would be better if you achieved your goal.
            -2.2 Write down one word that would reflect a significant barrier that stands in the way of achieving your goal.
            -2.3 Repeat 2.1
            -2.4 Repeat 2.2
        -3. Elaborate your answer to 2.1. Imagine all the benefits that would flow from this achievement.
        -4. Elaborate your answer to 2.2. Imagine how the obstacle hinders achievement and the steps that you would take to deal with it.
        etc.
    -Starting a long project: do a "pre-mortem"
    -Journal to complete when attempting to achieve a new goal or otherwise change your life:
        -1. What is your overall goal?
        -2. Break your overall goal into a maximum of five smaller steps. Each step should be associated with a goal that is concrete, measurable, realistic, and time-based. For each sub-goal...
            -2.1 My sub-goal is to...
            -2.2 I believe that I can achieve this goal because...
            -2.3 To achieve this sub-goal, I will...
            -2.4 This will be achieved by the following date:
            -2.5 My reward for achieving this will be...
            etc.
        -3. What are the benefits of achieving your overall goal? List three important benefits, focusing on how much better life will be for you and those around you.
    -don't be afraid of embarrassment

POSTURE
    -Shoulders back, chin up.
    -Sit up straight. Don't slouch.
    -Straight back?

PRACTICE / MEMORIZATION
    -Mix up problems. Interleave.
    -Try to stay in sweet spot. Mark the boundry of your curent ability, then aim a little beyond it:
        -Comfort zone
            -Sensations: Ease, effortlessness. You're working, but not reaching or struggling.
            -Percentage of successful attempts: 80+
        -Sweet spot
            -Sensations: Frustration, difficulty, alertness to errors. You're fully engaged in an intense struggle - as if you're stretching with all your might for a nearly unreachable goal, brushing it with your fingertips, then reaching again.
            -Percentage of successful attempts: 50-80
        -Survival zone
            -Sensations: Confusion, desperation. You're overmatched: scrambling, thrashing, and guessing. You guess right sometimes, but it's mostly luck.
            -Percentage of successful attempts: <50
    -Practice alone.
    -Simplify and spartan-ify the practice space.
    -Measure practice by "reaches", reps, and quality reps, not by total time spent.
    -Break every move down into chunks.
        1. What is the smallest single element of this skill that I can master?
        2. What other chunks link to that chunk?
    -practice sequential chunks out of sequence.
    -Seek a daily SAP: Smallest Achievable Perfection. aka a single perfect(able) chunk.
    -Embrace struggle
    -Practice very, very slowly.
    -Practice with your eyes closed (if at all possible).
    -To learn a new move, exaggerate it.
    -When you hit a plateu, modify your practice.
        Go slower, faster, or backwards, for instance
    -Embrace repetition
    -Stop (practising) before you're exhuasted
    -Focus on the success you want to achieve, rather than the failure you're trying to avoid.
    -Don't do "drills". Instead, play small, addictive games.
        -The governing principle is this: if it can be counted, it can be turned into a game.
        -Try something. Get a point for each successful attempt. Etc.
    -invent daily tests for yourself
    -rather than "do X 20 times", try "do X perfectly 5 times in a row"
    -Use mnemomnics to memorize things.
    -Use the sandwich technique to isolate and get rid of mistakes. When dealing with a mistake...
        -1. Make the correct move.
        -2. Make the incorrect move.
        -3. Make the correct move again.
    -To choose the best practice method, use the REPS method
        -R: Reaching and Repeating
            Does the practice have you operating on the edge of your ability, reaching and repeating?
        -E: Engagement
            Is the practice immersive? Does it command your attention? Does it use emotion to propel you toward a goal?
        -P: Purposefulness
            Does the task directly connect to the skill you want to build?
        -S: Strong, Speedy Feedback
            Does the learner receive a stream of accurate information about his performance - where he succeeded and where he made mistakes?
    -Pay attention immediately after you make a mistake.
    -Visualize your brain using the information gained from a mistake to increase the number of correct connections.
    -Pay attention also immediately after you finally get something right.
    -End practice sessions on a positive note.

PRACTISE - HIGH LEVEL / THEORY
    -Practice is, itself, a skill. It can be learned, improved.
    -When possible, practice immediately after a performance
    -To learn something more deeply, teach it
    -Identify hard skills vs soft skills.
        -Hard skills
            -ABC: Always Be Consistent
            -Be precise and measured. Go slowly. Make one simple move at a time, repeating and perfecting it before you move on. Pay attention to erros, and fix them, particularly at the start.
            -Always do the basic practices, even when you're advanced.
        -Soft skill
            -RRR: Reading, Recognizing, Reaction
            -Soft skills are built by playing and exploring inside challenging, ever-changing environments.
            -Experiment and make mistakes.
            -Focus on making a high number of varied reps, and on getting clear feedback.
        -Mixed skills
            -Prioritize the hard skills because in the long run they're more important to your talent.

READING - INTENSE
    -If something seems daunting, skim first. Look at chapter titles, illustrations, etc. Get a general lay of the land. (Maybe do so afterwards, as well?)
    -First read (maybe after skimming?), then try to write down what you read (or apply it; as applicable; the point is, test yourself), THEN re-read.
    -When trying to learn written material, read it once and then try to re-write it (or a summary of the salient points). (Then read it again to see what you got wrong?)

ROUTINE - DAILY
    -Kegels
    -Posture exercise (back against wall, 3x3x10)
    -Spend a few minutes each day (?) writing down your ideal future. Be realistic, but imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could, and you've achieved all your goals.
    -Similarly, spend a few minutes each day (?) writing down the most wonderful experience of your life.
    -Similarly, think about someone you love, and spend 20 minutes writing about why this person means so much to you.
    -Free association talking (10 min)

ROUTINE - WEEKLY
    -Once a week, write down five (for instance) things for which you are grateful. (or daily...)

ROUTINE - MORNING
    -Mobility, stretching
    -Make bed
    -Meditate
    -some kind of journaling? "Tim Ferriss morning journal"?
    -affirmations
        -From reddit: write down 3-4 goals 3-4 times every day (goals = lose 60 pounds, write a novel, etc)
    -In the morning, maybe think about and write down things I'm thankful for. #1 on the list of things that make people happy, according to some lady mentioned in "Pre-suasion". Source??
    -Some kind of breathing exercise
    -check calendar

ROUTINE - NIGHT
    -Am I ready for the next thing I'm going to do this week/month?
    -Write your to-do list for the following day.
    -Dead hang
    -In bed, just before going to sleep, play a mental movie of an idealized performance.

RUT - FEELING GROSS / DEPRESSED - HEADACHE
    -Shower
    -Drink a glass of water
    -Breathe deeply
    -Exercise

SCHEDULING
    -Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time.
    -Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it's only one pomodoro.
    -For practice, choose five minutes a day over an hour a week
    -Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.

SEEKING MENTORS
    1. Avoid someone who reminds you of a curteous waiter
    2. Seek someone who scares you a little
    3. Seek someone who gives short, clear instructions
    4. Seek someone who loves teaching fundamentals
    5. Other things being equal, pick the older person

SPACE
    -To increase productivity, work in an area where you can observe real plants (either inside or through the window).
    -practice space: Shrink the practice space (literally or figuratively). Find the minimum space needed to make the appropriate reaches and reps.
    -For creativity, decorate with images that showcase individuality or uniqueness.
    -For anyone in customer service (or works for many different situations, but CS is a big one) put a mirror behind you at the counter. This way angry customers who approach you will have to see themselves in the mirror behind you and the chances of them behaving irrationally lowers significantly. No one wants to see themselves act like a dickhead.
    -It is beneficial to (literally) stare at your idols, e.g., people who are good at the thing you want to be good at. Watch them work, imagine yourself in their place. Pictures are good, video is better. (Unsure the best way to apply this to writing. Quotes?)

STORY-TELLING - CASUAL
    -setup
    -pattern
    -foreshadowing
    -characters
    -relatability
    -twist / payoff / climax

STRESS
    -When you experience an event that has the potential to make you feel angry... spend a few moments thinking about the positive aspects of the event. Write down how you (may?) have benefited from the experience and how your life is better as a result of what happened. Do not withhold anything and be as honest as possible.
    -Praying for other people reduces your own stress.

UNDERSTANDING
    -Explain things to other people to understand them better.
    -Seek criticism from other people.

WRITING
    -stop writing in the middle of a thought or sentence
    -Write in 3 steps:
        -1. outline
        -1.5 outline VERY briefly, but specifically, what you're going to write in step 2.
        -2. write rough draft(s)
        -3. edit

SLOUCHING

STRESS
    - When you experience an event that has the potential to make you feel angry... spend a few moments thinking about the positive aspects of the event. Write down how you (may?) have benefited from the experience and how your life is better as a result of what happened. Do not withhold anything and be as honest as possible.
    -Praying for other people reduces your own stress.

WRITING
    do the highest number on this list that you can:
        1 outline briefly what you're going to write
        2 write rough draft(s)
        3 edit
    - stop writing in the middle of a sentence
        


    -Smile. Smile for 15-30 seconds. Try to make it especially genuine by thinking of something that makes you smile naturally.

        -Write down three things for which you are greatful.
        -Think back to a happy memory. Spend a few minutes writing it down, describing it.

        -Write a short letter to someone meaningful to you, telling them why they're meaningful, why you love them, etc.
        -Write down three things from the previous week that went well for you.
    -(Alternate formulation, from some site: "Write down three things that went well each day and their causes every night for one week. In addition, provide a causal explanation for each good thing.")
    -Spend ten minutes writing about your deepest feelings about your SO. Feel free to explore your emotions and thoughts.
    -Write one important positive quality that your partner has, and explain why this quality means so much to you.

Do intense exercise once a week
Grease the groove

motivation = (expectancy x value) / (impulsiveness x delay)

For attacking the problem of low value: Get into a state of flow, perhaps by gamifying the task. Ensure the task has meaning by connecting it to what you value intrinsically. Get more energy. Use reward and punishment. Focus on what you love, wherever possible.

For attacking the problem of low expectancy: Give yourself a series of small, challenging but achieveable goals so that you get yourself into a "success spiral" and expect to succeed. Consume inspirational material. Surround yourself with others who are succeeding. Mentally contrast where you are now and where you want to be.

For attacking the problem of delay: Decrease the reward's delay if possible. Break the task into smaller chunks so you can get rewards each step of the way.

For attacking the problem of impulsiveness: Use precommitment. Set specific and meaningful goals and subgoal and sub-subgoals. Measure your behavior. Build useful habits.

pre-stage morning routine

wash face + moisturizer (plain argan oil?) + sunscreen

"Every morning I open Facebook, click on the "On This Day" feature, and delete just about everything there."
I have noticed though that FB doesn't even show you all of your own stuff in that feature. I usually have to reload the page after finishing twice to make sure I got it all.

"I brush my teeth while standing on one foot, which I believe helps me with my balance. Right food, bottom teeth, one minute. Left foot, top teeth, one minute. Sometimes I wave the free leg around to amuse myself and see what sort of fancy positions I can get into or try to do one-legged squats." [left-hand?]

"Writing a short highlights of my day in my bullet journal so I get out the things emotionally hit me that day"

"Before leaving work, I write down three actionable & achievable things to do tomorrow."

"I (try to) do a hundred pushups every day, scattered throughout the day."

"The three-minute pickup!"

"Pretty much every day I check my bank balance online and see what bills have cleared that day and then update my monthly spreadsheet as things clear. "

"5 minutes of stretching"

"Every day ask the question, "What can I do today which means I will feel that I have used the day well at the end of the day?" "

"(Here's a summary of the Miracle Morning routine if you don't feel like getting the book: Silence, Affirmation, Visualisation, Scribing/Journaling, Reading, and Exercise)"

"Came here to also mention The Artist's Way morning pages, three longhand pages of free association as soon as possible upon waking. (In my case, right after feeding the dog and getting coffee.) I've done this for more than a decade and it has made a huge difference to my mood and sense of perspective."

** 4 steps re: OCD

"25 years of compulsive urges and obsessive thoughts made my brain an unbearable place. Suicide was the obvious solution. "Brain Lock", by Jeffrey M. Schwartz, MD saved my life. On my arm is written the Four Step Self Treatment Method. Cognitive behavioral therapy can rid us of our nightmare!"

"Relabel: you call the intrusive thought or urge to do a troublesome compulsive behavior exactly what it is: an obsessive thought or a compulsive urge. The question arises, "why is this bothering me?"

Reattribute: you say, "It keeps bothering me because I have a medical condition called OCD. I am having the symptoms of a medical problem."

Refocus: refocus your attention on another behavior by doing something useful and positive.

Revalue: you will learn to devalue unwanted obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges as soon as they intrude. You will come to see intrusive OCD symptoms as the useless garbage they really are."
