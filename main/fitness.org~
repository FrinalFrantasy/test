There's a big difference between endurance exercise and endurance training. Endurance exercise is good for you. Serious endurance training is actually not really. We know this from the inverted U-shaped association between the dose of strenuous exercise and longevity (e.g. the Copenhagen jogger study: casual jogging is best, serious jogging is no healthier than being sedentary).

I strongly suspect the same is true for resistance exercise (casual lifting is healthy, serious bodybuilding/powerlifting training is not).

Endurance exercise is not going to tank your testosterone without you noticing. You'll feel run down. If your priority is health rather than performance improvement, simply stick to the amount of exercise that makes you feel better rather than worse than usual. The typical recommended amount of endurance exercise (30-45 min, 2-3x/week) does not make most people feel run down. Most people feel better and more energetic.
