Was in a hotel or something with two people: a man, and an alternate, evil version of Sarah. Actually this happened twic,e but I can only remember one of them now. There was some variation on the theme of this man having some weird powers or properties, and evil-Sarah being secretely in league with him, and them trying to take advantage of or kill me, and me trying to escape them. In the instance I remember, the man didn't seem to have much ability to move or speak, but if you looked at him more than once, then something awful happened; I think it was either, he took control of you, or he just suddenly killed you. I saw him once in the hotel, so I knew I couldn't look at him again, and I was kind of panicking because this seemed so difficult. I remember wandering around with my eyes closed, feeling with my hands, trying to maniuplate things. At one point I climbed out the window and down the fire escape. I recall also going by the ground floor of the hotel, which had a complementary breakfast, and missing this breakfast, because I knew that the man and evil-Sarah were plotting to get me while I went there.
Although I don't remember the other instance of dealing with the man and evil-Sarah, I did remember it while I was dealing with the one described above. I remember thinking something along the lines of, "How am I going to get out of it THIS time?".

Standing in line for some sort of ticket. Ticket was for something important, like permission to have arguments for the rest of my life, or something.

I found myself on a ship called "Titanic", which predictably, and quite unironically, began to sink. It didn't hit an iceberg, it just was hit by a very large storm. I think I was on it with Vati and Margaret. I remember a bit of running around. I also remember seeing the crew start to throw passengers' checked (but not carry-on, thankfully) luggage overboard. I remember a certain fear of death. I also remember trying to get to... something (presumably a computer) to send a message that would active it a few days, and be one of those in-case-I-die sort of messages. Without noticing the discrepency, I went completely off the boat and away from the storm (I think I was at Vati and Mutti's house) in my attempt to create this missage. I never quite figured out how, though. Eventually I made my way back to the ship and met up with Vati and Margaret (or whomever it was) and the storm was much less severe, and it was apparent that the ship was not going to sink.

Uncle Rick showed me video camera, I told him about Go Pro Silver 4 I saw
Turtles and/or facehuggers in the bathtub, Cyprian trying to help
Accidentally leaving the kids at home all night, staying at a weird hotel or something with Sarah, barely any sleep, her panicking before work

Dreamt I was very rich.

** 2016-09-1/2

I sat in on a college course with Zack Candy. It was a course on logic, high-level, and a lot like the classes with Elodin in Kingkiller; few students, very bright, and the teacher didn't even show up until near the end. Then there was some connection with an underground club (both literally and figuratively). You had to go around a sort of circular back alley and then down a ladder and then step over a corpse to get to this secret club in a sewer-ish room. At one point the place flooded and I couldn't get in.

** 2016-09-7/8

I went to work at a shady place that processed chickens. "Shady" in the sense that they were the kind of place that mistreats the chickens or violates health codes or something, and are aggressive to anyone they think might be a whistleblower. I remember the place was out in the middle of the desert, and I think there were guards or cameras or something outside. There were two other employees, who both quit. The boss didn't like my Keanu Reeves screensaver. At some point I tried to find a way to hide a MicroSD card on my person, possibly in order to whistleblow the organization.

** 2016-10-26/27

I was playing/living some sort of game like Just Cause or Gmod. I was trying to control two different players, one in a blimp and one in an airplane or something. I got both in the blimp, then crashed it. Then I used the rising heat from the flaming blimp wreckage to fly around (new character?) on a hangglider. Very fun.

** 2018-11

Something like...

I wandered into a not very secure, but scary ish (most like Stranger Things Hawkins Energy plant) facility, got through a door, code wasn't 0451 but was similar, room was called.... ahhh I can't remember what it was called, something mundane though, like "Beach 08" or something", and I got the code to get in from 4chan, and once you got in there you were in the important rooms, but there was the one room, the important one, where there were eight people hooked up to... torture machines? They basically were in pure suffering all day. I think the code was actually ONOYO (meaning later?). There was also a girl, but here it gets fuzzy. My involvement and breaking in led to the girl getting released. I don't know whether she was one of the eight or what. She got in a brutal fight for her life. A worker or someone, another woman I think, was fighting her, and somehow in the fight this girl lost her arm, but killed the other person, and ended up attaching something to her stump to create a sort of weapon-arm. Then, I THINK, she killed some more workers, and all eight of the people in the room, or the remainders, or whatever (mercy killings), I was gone at this point. It's also possible that I had set the eight free or whatever... anyway. Later the Stranger Things ish director was talking to me about how they had to discontinue that program or whatever, and he was personable and explaining things in a way that made it all sound good, but the last thing he said revealed that now the fighting girl was hooked up the way the eight were, and she was getting all of the punishment. The reveal was that the room or code or whatever wasn't called "Beach" or whatever but was her name, it was like now the "Ella room" or whatever. And I looked up ONOYO or whatever on the internet and it was an acronym for something that meant "that only one should suffer", and I understood that the purpose of the room and the machine was the funnel all the suffering from some other people into the person hooked up to the machine.

Then later I tried to break in again and I got caught and a lot of our stuff got stolen and I was afraid of being hooked up to the machine etc. yay

Sarah took the kids in the morning while I worked downstairs (cleaning my office and scanning vital documents). Aunt Sue came by briefly with a friend to say hi, then for lunch we had the H family over (everyone sans Anna and Matt). Minor political discussion after eating. Then Elle took the kids for the rest of the day. Sarah and I met with Becky Young to talk about our investments, then we took a walk along the beach and to the end of the pier (non-lighthouse side). The waves were pretty strong, and the lighthouse-side of the pier was obviously unsafe to walk on. We saw a few windsurfers. Then we checked what movies were playing at the nearby Celebration Cinema, and went to see Florence Foster Jenkins. Then we went to a Chinese buffet in Benton Harbor. We also were in contact with Naomi and Margaret, and made a plan to visit Fort Wayne tomorrow. Then we came home. Sarah chatted with Elle for a long time before she left (I contributed a little bit to the conversation).

** 09 Sep
*** 04 Tue

Ran with Sarah in the evening. Dad went out with Anna to get her a ring. Zippy did well. Had Mom and Matt over to eat. Church in the morning; Divine Service, lots of pastors, due to the circuit council meeting Pastor was hosting. After church, Sarah and I went to Good Will (I got some khaki ripstop pants and a nice tan vest; she got a set of scrubs), then to Aldi... ran with Sarah in evening, then stretched and breathed.

*** 05 Wed

AC guy came and fixed AC, insurance guy came and photographed the house. Dad came by and he and I got some blocks for the chimney, and mortar, and cut a hole in the floor. Went to evening prayer. Talked to Nick about college, which he just recently started. Stretching and breathing with Sarah.

*** 06 Thu

Woke up early, had a quick run. Worked on To Tread Among Men and played Revenge of the Titans while Sarah ran some errands. In the afternoon, started building the chimney with Dad. Finished in time to have a nice meal at Mom and Dad's, with Karen and Grandma and Grandpa Harrison. Saw Annalise's ring. Last time seeing Annalise before December. Work at night.

*** 07 Fri

After work, was pretty tired. Went by Meijer on the way home to check for old and potentially valuable Magic: the Gathering stuff. Found nothing of that description, but did browse products for a while. Came home. Sarah had made a nice breakfast of pancakes and eggs and bacon. Went to bed. Did not really emerge until the evening, and had just enough time to see Vati's Operatic Irregulars production, with Margaret in a good role as a housemaid. Sarah had to feed Cyprian through much of the first half. I held him for most of the second half, while he slept. Chatted with people after the play; kissed Sarah and Cyprian goodnight, got some food from Taco Bell, and went to work.

*** 08 Sat

Home from work, slept a bit, got up and went to Magic Mini master tournament. Lost twice, but had fun and got some decent cards. Came home. Sarah was canning apples with Bekah, Melissa, and Mutti. Went to bed, but slept very poorly. Went to work quite tired.

*** 09 Sun

Home from work, went to Fort Wayne, saw Grobiens, cousins, Emma's baptism... Only very brief chat with Adam, Samuel. After installation, chatted with sem people. On way home, Vati and Sarah and self spent an hour (and combined eighty five dollars) at Half Price Books. I got Jonathan Strange, among others. Got home quite exhausted.

*** 15 Sat

Slept, messed around with Dolphin emulator. Sarah canned tomatoes with Mom and Grandma Harrison. Supper at Harrisons'. Goofed off with Matt.

*** 16 Sun

Worked, went to parents', went to church. Guest pastor, Pr. Frese, talked about being a military chaplain in Afghanistan. Had lunch at Vati and Mutti's, hung out a bit, quick trip to Aldi, then came home. At home, we had supper, then Sarah and I went to bed very early (about 6:30) because we were both so exhausted. At 11:30 I was woken up by a call from Jason Douglas. Apparently when he asked if I could take the night's shift and I said "maybe", he put me down as a "yes". After consideration, I decide to do the rest of the shift, and drive to work.

*** 17 Mon

    Came home from work, ran with Sarah while Mom watched Cyprian. Went back to Mom and Dad's house. Mom mentioned that Sue and Rick might be asking us for a place to say Dec - Jan. Dad got home from assessor, distinctly ruffled, saying that he and Mom had to pay some extra taxes. Homesteaded vs non-homesteaded issue. The long and short of it is that the Chemical Bank loan delay caused the trouble. After this, I slept for most of the day. No church because Pastor was out of town. Sarah and I took care of a few pieces of very minor business, had Supper, then went on a nice long walk with Cyprian in the backpack on my shoulders. Talked about my potential webcomic. Came home, I wrote.

*** 18 Tue

Got up, ran. Lunch and mom and dad's. Came home, laid bricks for the chimney, up through the basement ceiling, with Dad's help. While washing tools, a pregnant-looking praying mantis landed on my back. Quick nap, then Supper at parents'. Back home, read Order of the Phoenix to Sarah, went to bed. Spent a while in bed, before sleeping, joking with Sarah about how all our itty future kids would act.

*** 19 Wed

Worked at Unity Hospital. Went pretty well. Got home and immediately went "running" (95% walking) with Sarah; feet hurt, but a good time. Madeline watched Zippy. Back home, late Supper, then fell into bed.

*** 20 Thu

Got out of bed at 9:30 due to being so exhausted from yesterday. Had familiar effect on day, though not as bad as it could have been. Sort of hung out for a while. Lunch at parents'. Got some tax forms from Dad, as well as bill from the power company, which is still trying to bill Dad and not us. Went apple picking at Frank Farms with Sarah and Cyprian. Came back, Hayley came over to chat for a few hours. Then Supper, then a nap for me. Got up just slightly late. Went to work.

*** 23 Sun

Worked, went to Vati and Mutti's. Church. Potluck in church later, partially to get to know new people (Notre Dame students especially). Sarah and I mostly hang out with Zach and Bekah. Come home, I take a nap. Regular stuff in the evening.

*** 24 Mon

Got up a little late, too tired to run. Slow start to day. Went with Sarah (and Cyprian) to take care of errands. Got two of the tires on the Subaru patched, got title for Subaru, went to the bank to deposit some checks and start the process of fixing the tax ID number on our property (she said she'd call back on Monday, after she was able to talk to the township treasurer or somesuch). Tried to get license plate but was unable to today. Back at home, I wrote (not fiction; E-mails to many friends) for a few hours while Sarah napped on the couch, and Zippy napped/ate/flopped on her chest. After this, we went on a run, our first run with Cyprian in the stroller. He did very well, and seemed much soothed by the movement. Back at home, we had Supper, did some reading (currently nearing the end of Order of the Phoenix), and went to bed earlyish (got a call earlier offering a Maxim shift out at Unity for tomorrow; accepted it).

** 10 Oct
*** 07 Sun

Finished work, went to church. Lunch at Vati and Mutti's. Hung out for a while. I took a brief nap while Sarah went to Aldi. Drove home. Much talking with Sarah.

*** 08 Mon

Got up a bit late. Mostly worked on the chimney with Dad today. Wood furnace was delivered and we got it downstairs. Got a call from Mark at Maxim, asking if I wanted to change my next two days at Unity to days at Courtyard (a place I have not worked at before). I agree.

*** 09 Tue

Worked at Courtyard.

*** 10 Wed

Worked at Courtyard.

*** 24 Wed

Went to library for four or five hours to write; was to be first of many such times, though ended up being the only one, I think. After it, I came home and spent time with Sarah.

*** 25 Thu

Sarah and I went to Bethel and I mailed transcripts to SMC and LMC. Then we hung out with Margaret for a bit. I went to a meeting at Samlind. Then I came home, and we served dinner to Matthew and Mom. Then I went to sleep, then I went to work.

*** 28 Sun

Work, then church. Adult choir practice. Back home, napped for several hours. Sarah too. In the evening, we watched the first half of a version of Macbeth starting Ian McKellan.

*** 29 Mon

Ran with Sarah and Cyprian in the morning. Went to Renebergs to pay for the fix Mr. Reneberg effected on the Subaru catalytic converter pipe. Visited the family briefly. Went back home, did stuff, back to family, watched first in series of Hillsdale videos re: the Constitution. I applied online to SMC and LMC. Back home. Went to church in the evening. Chatted with Nick. Cyprian laughed at Nick's funny faces. Back home, Sarah watched me play FTL.

*** 30 Tue

Sarah was initially called off for today, but she was asked to be on-call and come in in the likely event that there was an admit. Then the unit secretary called off, so Sarah ended up going in (only a little later than usual) to fill in for that position, as well as help out as able. She had an eye splash from an IV early on, but it was from about the healthiest guy there, so she wasn't worried. She came home early. Meanwhile, I didn't ask Mom to watch Cyprian, as I wanted to leave her free to concentrate on her upcoming deposition. I ran in the morning. Dad came over and we started the wood stove for the first time. No leaks. Throughout the day I brought in some wood. Spent time at family's. Worked on FAFSA but did not finish.

** 11 Nov
*** 04 Sun

Though I am tired from work, Sarah and I have lunch at Vati and Mutti's after church. The Seybolts are over, and I chat with Aaron. Back at home, I get into a big airsoft battle with Luke, Matt, and Dad.

*** 05 Mon

Morning errands. Sarah went to a baby shower for someone at work while I finished a FAFSA. Then we went to SMC and I discussed things with a Chelsey.

*** 06 Tue

Sarah and myself went out to vote, with Cyprian in tow. Sarah then went to work. I spent the day watching Cyprian, studying math, and discussing job opportunities with Mom. She mentions the possibility of me assisting with the class for homeschoolers.

*** 07 Wed

Sarah's birthday. She has a morning meeting at LTAC. I study math at the parents'; news comes in that Obama was re-elected, marijuana legalized, etc. Sarah also has a dentist check-up today. Sarah and I and Cyprian go disc golfing at Rum Village, then pick up Margaret from Bethel and get pizza from Papa Johns. Then church, then we hand out with Mutti, discussing things. We take Margaret back to Bethel before going home. It is a late night, and Cyprian seems frustrated that his schedule is postponed.

*** 11 Sun

Talent show at church. Afterward, went home. Cyprian slept a lot. Not feeling well? I took a nap. We went over to the family's for supper. Played some games with Matt and Luke (Smokin' Guns).

*** 12 Mon

Sarah and I transported Luke and Matt to various appointments due to Mom and Dad being indisposed.

*** 14 Wed

Sarah worked. I felt rather down and found it hard to get things done. But I did go to SMC and do the math placement test.

*** 15 Thu

Slow start to day. Zippy generally fussy. Did laundry with Sarah. Sarah worked at LTAC for 3 hours. Very late lunch. Then Sarah and I helped out Mom on the phone because Mom was in Austin stranded at the airport. Then Sarah and I finalized our healthcare benefits through LTAC for the coming year.

** 12 Dec
*** 09 Sun

Work went well enough, I worked on consolidating notes and such. I also finished reading The Little Book of Talent. Good stuff. Then church, after which was a very long but interesting Voter's Meeting. The issue of Heidi and the secretarial position was brought up, with the eventual decision that the Elders or Board or someone would examine the positions (secretarial and custodial) and we would decide what to do at a future meeting, to which Heidi would be invited. After this, Sarah and I went to Vati and Mutti's and had lunch. Margaret and Melissa were there too. Matt came with us, as the rest of the Harrisons were busy (Mom taking care of a sick Luke, Dad working). After lunch, Matt and I played Halo 2. Then we all went home, and Sarah and I, quite exhausted, flopped onto the couch and slept until like seven or eight or something. Then we had a late supper, then played a lot of Prince of Persia: Sands of time. Didn't get to bed until practically midnight. Then talked in bed for a while.

*** 11 Tue

Got up at 7 and wrote for an hour and a half ("The Pieces of Carrow, Demswick and Greaves"). Made oatmeal for self and Sarah. I did dishes while Sarah did laundry. Took Zippy to the parents and went on a run (37:10) and we followed not only by the mutt dog but a big Great Dane which we led back to his house. Came home and stretched (Sarah's back was very sore), then had lunch with the family, and I helped Luke set up the laptop he got from Sarah. Sarah talked with Mom and Dad about the recent Voter's Meeting, at which Heidi's position was discussed. Came back home. I watched Zippy while Sarah napped, then she went to work. I took a long nap (2 hours), then went back to the family's to help Luke some more. While I was there Zippy started choking badly (apparently on spit or reflux). He was very distressed and coughing off and on for the next half hour at least. Took him home, bathed him, got supper ready. Dad dropped by to check and Zippy and on the wood stove. Said he'd come by in the morning to hook it up to the duct work. Sarah came home (she had worked only a few hours; she only went in to due wound work with Dr. Gomez), and we had our bedtime routine. Finished Prince of Persia: Sands of Time while Zippy became entirely too distracted and decided to stop nursing.

*** 12 Wed

Sarah worked today. I got up earlyish, but failed to get any writing done; just played computer games. In the morning, Dad came over and he and I hooked the wood furnace into the vent system. Made the house much warmer. I spent most of the day inbetween LTAC runs at Mom and Dad's (just me, Dad and Cyprian), organizing all of my notes (putting many old .txt files into TiddlyWikis and SimpleNotes), and fixing up Luke's laptop (Sarah's old Erasmus). I reinstalled Windows XP, updated all the drivers, put a few games on it, etc. Sarah worked as an aide today. Not the best day for her. Was hit on by a creepy (non-demented) patient, and lost the ring Dad gave her (while she was washing her hands). Handled it pretty well. In the evening, we went over the family's for supper. Sarah talked to Mom and Dad about the guy who had hit on her, and about Lakeland sexual harassment policies and so forth, while Matt and Luke and I messed around with the computer, my phone, Matt's iPad, and various games and such. Before we left, Dad got out some old picture albums featuring him and Mom, Grandma and Grandpa Harrison, Sue and Rick Nivens, and some other people.

*** 13 Thu

Came home, Sarah made hash browns. Talked with her for a while, then slept. Woke up and had a quick run. Got the house together and had Susan and Rick over (them having just recently returned from Indonesia). Very pleasant time. Afterwards, Sarah and I talked more, especially concerning my various plans. Then I went to work.

*** 14 Fri

Got up and wrote for a while ("The Pieces of Carrow, Demswick, and Greaves"). Then hung out with Sarah until I went to work. Just a short three hours at Holy Cross House, covering while the regular employees had a party or something. Came back home. Sarah and I lazed about for a while, then went over to the family's and, with Mom (and Zippy), took a walk in the forest. Came home, had supper, slept, went to work.

*** 16 Sun

Work, then church. Christmas Pageant after service instead of Bible class. Adult choir practice after that, though Sarah was feeling stressed and overwhelmed and went instead to Vati and Mutti's to recuperate. After choir, went to Vati and Mutti's, hung out for a bit, then headed home (brief stop at Aldi). At home, the hand on the trunk to the Subaru broke and I rigged up an alternative. Sarah and I went to bed by 9.

*** 17 Mon

Woke up late, after way too much sleep. Felt bad most of the day because of it. Went on a run with Sarah.

*** 18 Tue

Woke up at 7. Sarah went to work. Got up, tried to write, but didn't really get anything down. Mostly spent the day taking Cyprian to Sarah, reading, and hanging out with the family. Watched The Amazing Spider-Man. Pretty bad movie. Sarah didn't get home until 22:20. Was quite exhausted.

*** 22 Sat

Grandpa Harrison's surprise birthday party. Good party, lots of people there, lots of passing Cyprian around. Some hanging out with Michael and David. David and I sat with Cyprian for a long time. I went home before Sarah so as to get some sleep before work.

*** 23 Sun

After church, hung out with my family. Vati sang to Cyprian in German. Then we came home and took a nap, then went to Mom and Dad's house and hung out with some of the relatives who had come for Grandpa H's party.

*** 24 Mon

Opened some Christmas presents with the Harrison family (including my Barmah).

*** 25 Tue

Christmas. Went to Grandma Uffelmans'. Sarah had to work. I did not stay the night, but left, also taking Margaret back with me. She and I talked in the car about future life plans etc.

*** 26 Wed

Kinda bad day; accomplished very little. Cyprian started feeling less than great.

*** 27 Thu

Christmas with the Rhein family.

*** 28 Fri

Sarah started feeling sick. In the evening, Vati brought Margaret over to spend the night and watch Cyprian the following day.

*** 29 Sat

Margaret watched Cyprian. Cyprian was feeling pretty bad. No voice, barely slept or ate. At the end of the day, I drove Margaret home before going to work.

*** 30 Sun

Church, Sarah stayed home with Cyprian as neither of them were feeling very well. I brought Nick back with me. In the evening, I took a nap. Then we all hung out at the Harrisons' for Supper, after which the boys and Nick and I tried to play some computer games, but got completely sidetracked by a serious discussion (all involved) re: watching The Gospel of John, snarkiness, gossiping, value of media, evaluation of overtly theological movies, etc.

*** 31 Mon

Luke and Matt came over shortly before noon and they and I and Nick played computer games for about 4 hours. Smokin' Guns, FEAR, Red Faction, and a bit of Hidden and Dangerous 2 (though we were unable to get this to work on Nick's computer). Nick went with the Harrisons when they went to church. Sarah felt very bad today and had no voice. Sarah and I slept through the new year changeover.

* 2013
** 01 Jan
*** 01 Tue

Sarah still felt very bad and had no voice. Dad looked at her and pronounced her ailment viral. She had to call off work. She and I took a walk in the evening.

*** 02 Wed

I (I think; it might have been both of us) cleaned the bedroom and the house in general, then went to the Harrisons' for lunch. After this I tried to work out an internet plan for us, with much difficulty. In the evening, Sarah and I went on a walk, pulling Cyprian behind us in the sled. Sarah still not feeling the best.

*** 06 Sun

After work, went to Vati and Mutti's. No one there (Vati and Mutti visiting Amanda, Margaret with Robin). Went to church. Cyprian made a mess of himself and Sarah. Family drove away with car seat, but we borrowed one from the Stuckwisches. Came home, had lunch, puttered about, had a nap, then went to the family's for supper. Hung out for a bit after than, but not terribly long. Then back home and to bed a bit late.

*** 08 Tue

Got up an hour an a half late, puttered about, took Cyprian to Sarah. Back, took a short run, then had lunch with the family, then back to Sarah. Back again, puttered about again, took a brief nap, then back to Sarah. After this, went to the family's, chatted with Dad (he was working on converting the garage pantry room into a sewing room + pantry), chatted with Elle, chatted with boys... came home for a bit, went back for Supper and to work on my new schedule for a bit. Came back when Sarah got back, and I worked on the schedule until late. Then emptied ash bin, stoked the fire, showered, went to bed.

*** 09 Wed

Good day. Writing in the morning, then a run, then off to the family's. Finished (first version of) life schedule for coming months, and printed it out. Another discussion with Mom and Dad re: my career choice. Was very sleepy after this, at about 4, and took a long nap with Sarah (Cyprian also napped) at home. Were going to go to ReStore after this, but decided to postpone until tomorrow. Went to church. After church, Elle took charge of Cyprian while Sarah and I went to Hacienda. Both had a frozen glass of margarita, which neither of us were quite able to finish. Good date. Got back kinda sleepy and groggy.

*** 10 Thu

Got up a bit late, kind of puttered about. Instead of a run, went to ReStore. Got big desk ($100), big rug ($60), and some paint for my office. Also got some paint for Mom, for her office. Were only able to take smallest pieces of desk in Subaru, though. Came home. Before long, Sarah had to go in to work (she had offered a part-shift today). After she left, I called to the family's to see if I could borrow the truck to get the rest of the desk. Dad was working on the truck, but after an hour he said I could use it. I handed Cyprian to Elle and drove to the ReStore, getting there shortly before it closed. I and the one mover guy managed to get the desk in the truck, though it wasn't easy. Started to rain on my way back, so desk got a bit wet, but whatever. Matt and Luke helped me get it downstairs. Again: not easy. Went to the family's for homemade pizza, of which I brought some back for Sarah. Bathed Cyprian, said hi to Sarah, then slept until time for work. Then went for work. Also: Cyprian has a cold and (by the end of the day) a fever. Seems happy enough, but definitely stuffy and coughing, also throwing up a lot. Spectacular vomit all over Sarah, the couch, and my copy of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel. Sarah gave him some children's Tylenol, I believe.

*** 15 Tue

Slept in a bit while Sarah went to work. Mom called around 09:40, said that Grandma Harrison had had a stroke, and asked me to take care of Matt's transportation for the day. Elle and Luke left earlier in the morning. I took Cyprian to Sarah, then picked up Matt from Andrews, and went home and had lunch with him. Then took Matt to SMC, then went back to Sarah, back home for a bit, picked up Matt from SMC, took him home, and once more to Sarah. Didn't accomplish much else during the day, though did play some Far Cry 2.

*** 16 Wed

Slept in a bit while Sarah went to work. Again. Once again, picked up Matt from Andrews, though he didn't have class at SMC today. Took Cyprian to his feedings with Sarah. He did pretty well today, seems to be mostly recovered from his cold or flu or whatever. Wanted to paint my office today, but never really got the opportunity. Went to work at night - one of my extra shifts.

** 02 Feb
*** 03 Sun

Went to Vati and Mutti's, went to church. Sarah stayed for Bible Class, but not for adult choir practice afterward. Sarah went to Kroger during that time for a few extra groceries. At Vati and Mutti's, hung out just a bit before heading back home. At home, moved garage sale desk downstairs into office, as well as a bunch of stuff from upstairs.

*** 04 Mon

Sarah and I were responsible for Matt and Luke's transportation for the day, because Dad was working and Mom was in DC (I think) doing Pro-Life work. I took Matt to his first class, at around 8. Back home, I spent most of my free time setting up and organizing my office. Sarah did most of the transportation. In the evening, she and I (and Cyprian) took Matt and Luke to CAP, and we waited there and watched Sherlock (season 2, episode 2) while we waited for them. Then came back home. Note that today Cyprian had his biggest "real" food meal yet, and only the second that he hasn't thrown up any of. He had several tablespoons of rice cereal mixed with breast milk or water, and several tablespoons of applesauce. We also gave him for the first time a sippy cup of warm water, which he liked very much.

*** 05 Tue

Got up about 7:45. Sarah at work today. Worked downstairs for a bit. At 9:15 or so, dropped Cyprian off with Dad, and went to get my TB test. After that, went to a few stores (finally Walmart) to get binder clips etc. Came back home, got Cyprian again, took him to his other two nursings (though Sarah was busy for the last one and I had to come home and give him a bottle). At home, invited Dad and the boys over and served them fish stick pie. Also fed Cyprian some rice cereal. Showed Dad and the boys the new crib and my office. Let Zippy have a baby spoon, which he jammed in his throat, making him throw up. After everyone else left, I bathed Cyprian, gave him a bottle, and put him to bed. When Sarah got home, she and I showered, she had Supper, then she mended my sweatshirt and fed Cyprian while I read to her ("The Deathly Hallows").

*** 06 Wed

Got up, did some work. A bit wet for running, so Sarah and I walked through the big pasture, pulling Cyprian behind on his little sled. Back at home, did more work. Sarah was not working today due to taking a co-worker's call-off. Sarah took a nap in the afternoon. In the evening, we went to Walmart (for various things) and Lowe's (for childproofing things, including the first plexiglass book shield), and after that, to church. Came back home and went to bed.

*** 07 Thu

Got up, did some work. Again it was rather wet for running, and anyway there were no Harrisons around at the moment, so Sarah and I again went walking through the woods, with Cyprian behind us in his sled. In the afternoon, I went to get my TB test read, then we went for our eye appointments and ordered second pairs of glasses for each of us. We came back home, and in the evening invited Mom and Dad and Matt and Luke over for Supper. Afterward, Matt and Luke and I played some Hidden and Dangerous 2 in my office. Then I took a nap and went to work.

*** 08 Fri

Got home, stopping at Walmart on the way to buy a cheap mouse and keyboard. Back at home, did some work in the office, somehow convinced myself it was okay not to go running, then collapsed into bed. Sarah had a shorter shift today, 07:00 to 15:30, as an aide. I woke up around 16:30, she was at Mom and Dad's, then she came home. We went back over for Supper, then at home we watched episode 6 of Sherlock and cuddled and talked a bit. We each had one glass of wine. Sarah talked about feeling tired. Then I went to work.

*** 12 Tue

I drove Matt to school in the morning. Sarah got him at the end, while I ran alone. Sarah worked a part day today.

*** 13 Wed

Got up late. Sarah was working. I ran with Cyprian in the stroller.

*** 14 Thu

Woke up on time. Wrote in the morning, though only got about 50 words down ("The Pieces..."). Normalish day. Went running with Sarah and Cyprian, time of 42:51. Lots of work on math (algebra) in the afternoon, then dropped Cyprian off with Mom and Sarah and I went out for Valentine's Day. Had a nice conversation. Back home, sleep, then to work.

*** 15 Fri

Came home via Walmart (for some sundries). Played some computer games, wasted some time, went to sleep. Was woken at around 15:30 by Mom asking if I could take Cyprian to his 16:00 nursing, which I did. Came back home and he and I slept for about an hour and a half. Then did normal evening stuff until Sarah got back home. Spent some time with her, then went to work.

*** 16 Sat

Came home via McDonald's (for hotcakes and free Wi-Fi) and some auto shop (for a gas can). Got home, cleaned up a bit, went to sleep. Woke up around 17:30, was invited to Mom and Dad's for supper. Anna was back for a week due to the unreasonable orthodontist. Grandma and Grandpa Harrison were also over. Johnny Reneberg, too. Had supper, celebrated Matt's 15th birthday, went sledding with Matt and Luke and Anna and Johnny. Came back home to see Sarah and be with her until I had to go to work.

*** 17 Sun

Went from work to Vati and Mutti's. Place was deserted except for Vati (Mom in Kenya, Margaret in Fort Wayne, Melissa with her family). Went to church, Cyprian and Sherianne had a "conversation" and Sheri imitated Cyprian's way of sucking the first two fingers of one hand backward. After church, came back to R family's with Vati and Melissa, and had chili and cornbread made by Sarah. Before leaving, I lost my keys for a good hour, until we gave up and, heading to the car to go home, Sarah found them in the dirver's side door. On the way home got bread, milk, and gas. Back home, all of us took a nap, mine being the longest at about 3 hours. After that, supper, then to bed.

*** 18 Mon

Got up and went downstairs to my office to write. After an hour and a half, had typed one word and deleted two. Still on "Pieces". Ah well. We invited the family (Mom, Matt, Luke, Anna) over for lunch. Mom super stressed due to quickly-upcoming APLG (sp?) stuff. Before lunch, Anna watched Cyprian while Sarah and I went on a run. After lunch, Luke helped clean a bit, and Sarah and I helped out with transportation for Matt and Luke (for each trip, Anna drove while Sarah or I went in the passenger seat, so Anna could get in her required driving time). In the evening, we had supper at the H family's, and afterward (when Dad got home) played Pit. Then back home, a bit of Deathly Hallows, and to bed.

*** 19 Tue

Sarah doing wound care today. Cyprian had a doctor's appointment, which he really didn't enjoy. Still 100.00th percentile for weight; it was 25.4 (or maybe 24.4) pounds, hard to remember. ~80th percentile for height and ~55th percentile for head size, I think. Doctor Lello told us very diplomatically that he is now a bit overweight, so we'll work on that. She also prescribed a minor antibiotic for what appears to be a mild ear infection.

*** 20 Wed

Sarah worked today, I took care of Cyprian. Fairly unexciting. I remember I got up rather late, at 8:20 roughly. No run or walk. Went with the H family to church (soup supper and vespers) in the evening. Chatted with various people. After church, and after confirming with both Pastor and Mr. Tribble, I took home the unused DVI monitor in the church office.

*** 21 Thu

Sarah worked the first half of the shift today. I got up at a good time and spent most of the morning setting up my office with the new monitor, and wasting time. After the ten o'clock feeding, I took Cyprian in the backpack carrier and went on about a 75-minute hike through the woods. Cyprian slept through the first hour and cried during the rest. Got back home, and not too long after, Sarah got home. After taking care of Cyprian and showering and all that, she and I took about an hour-long nap. Then I went downstairs and worked a bit while she did dishes and got supper ready. After supper we slept for another two hours, then I went to work.

*** 24 Sun

Worked, went to Vati and Mutti's. Then to church. Pastor Osbun preached and led Bible Class (a look into his personal project of collecting and studying American-published English Lutheran major hymnals). Mutti still in Kenya, Mom still doing APLOG stuff, Matt still at some CAP thing, Elle still away, Anna back in Canada... so a smallish extended family at church. I handed Sander a flash drive with FTL, Revenge of the Titans, Braid, and some other stuff on it. Sarah and I went to R family's for lunch, which was cooked by Sarah and Melissa. Margaret did not join us as there was play practice after church. After eating, we hung out a bit, used the internet, Vati showed us some Charlie Chaplin... then Sarah and I went to Aldi, leaving Cyprian with Vati and the just-returned Margaret. Then we came back and grabbed Cyprian and headed home. At home, we napped for an hour, then went to the H family's (Mom now returned) for Supper. Cyprian babbled constantly and played with Mom for over an hour. Luke talked about some guns he was looking at online, and showed us his latest, enormous pack. I did some research into Yagi antennas. Then, back home, and to bed, after Sarah read me a few stories out of our American Folk Tales book.

*** 25 Mon

Got up rather late (8:30), feeling quite groggy. Had breakfast with Sarah, then went downstairs to do some work. Dug out old Linksys E1000 router. Went over to family's to install DD-WRT and try to get router working as a wireless bridge. Also did much research into Yagi antenna, cantenna, etc. Was not ultimately successful. Matt is apparently in big trouble for something and banned from computer games for the remainder of the semester. In the evening, Sarah and Cyprian and I went for a little walk. Then supper at home, then some Dreamfall, then bed.

*** 26 Tue

I spent a lot of this day working on getting the routers running so that Sarah and I could get a working internet connection. Didn't make a lot of progress, but did achieve some necessary first steps (of understanding, primarily).

*** 27 Wed

Spent a lot of today working on the router thing. With Sarah at work and the family gone early to South Bend, I spent a few hours at the H house, with Zippy, working on it. Finally got the Linksys router working as a repeater bridge, and a faint but usable signal (with Sarah's ThinkPad) at our house. Rewarded myself by playing a ton of Zuma Deluxe. Remembered Vespers and Soup Supper just in time to go down, taking along a bottle for Cyprian. Chatted with Josh Osbun (about his work, and cell phones) after eating and before the service.

*** 28 Thu

Got up at a normalish time. Spent the morning and most of the day researching routers, antennas, etc. Measured the distance between our house and H family's house. Had Mom and Matt and Luke over for lunch. Also spent a while responding to Scott Schreiber's post on Facebook re: politics. Cyprian is beginning to move around a bit, though mostly backwards.

** 03 Mar
*** 01 Fri

Stayed at work until 11 because Larry was late. Came back home (by way of Dairy Queen for an Oreo Blizzard), then went to bed, but only slept for around three and a half hours before Mom called: she was trying to get work done, but Cyprian needed attention and their internet was down. I went over, and the internet fixed itself. The boys were busy, and so was Mom, so I took Cyprian for the rest of the day. Fed him, took him home, did regular stuff. Wanted to nap while he napped, but he didn't nap. I gave him some food in the evening, if I recall correctly. Somewhere between six and seven I put him on my back and went hiking through the woods. Found the boys' camp (sans boys, plus fire). Put a notecard saying "bang!" in the muzzle of the Airsoft gun that was there. Went back home. Total time of walk was one hour. Zippy slept through all but the last ten minutes, during which he whined. Got back home, then Sarah got back home. She and I showered while Zippy wailed, then I went to bed until it was time for me to go to work.

*** 02 Sat

Normalish day at home. Spent the morning finishing my reply to Nick Strickland re: corporal punishment, then went to bed. Shortly after getting up, some guy (Victor) stopped by, asking if the goats were mine, and if any were for sale. I called Mom, who said she was not available at the moment, but to give the guy their phone number, which I did. Then the guy asked if he could just take a look, and I offered to walk out to the barn with him. Before we reached it, though, Matt came running from his house, and whispered to me that one of the goats was dead. So I told Victor it was a bad time and he left. Then Luke came down, and he and Matt and I carried the dead goat to the edge of the forest. Then I got my stuff from home and went to the H family's. It was Matt, Luke, Aaron, and Mom there. The boys were all a bit tired and headachy from staying up watching movies, or maybe not drinking enough water. Mom was in rather a good mood. We had supper, and afterward Mom went through lines with each of the boys (for the upcoming Emmaus production of Twelfth Night). I went home. At home, I did something for a bit, I don't remember what, then called Amanda, and we talked for a few minutes, but she was just sitting down to supper with Jordan, and asked if we could schedule a longer conversation for tomorrow. So we did. Shortly after that, Sarah got back home and we had a pretty standard night. Played a bit of Dreamfall.

*** 03 Sun

Went to R family's, brief nap, went to church. Forgot to cantor, oh well. After church, chatted with Zach and Nick re: Magic qualifying tournament, with Rick Tribble re: networking and Ubiquiti gear. Sarah and I stayed for the beginning of Bible Class but we very tired and so headed to R family's. There, I took a nap. Sarah made lunch early, so Margaret could have some before going back to church for play practice, then she (Sarah) napped with me. Then we got up, had lunch with Vati and Melissa, and headed back home. Cyprian was asleep when we got home so we took another nap, then went to H family's for supper. Hung out a little after supper. Came back home, waited to have phone conversation with Amanda, but as it happened, Amanda had a cold. Sarah read to me from her American Folk Tales book, then we went to bed. Sometime during church (I think) Nick Strickland messaged me, wondering if we could get together for tea/coffee/philosophy sometime. Have not responded yet.

*** 04 Mon

Got up, did stuff. Kind of a slow start to the day. I forget what I did at first. After lunch, Sarah and Cyprian both took a long nap. Luke came over, helped me do dishes, then we played some Hidden and Dangerous 2, and before he left I gave him Ground Control and Battlezone.

*** 07 Thu

Got up, did stuff. Internet finally up and running pretty well (new router as repeater bridge linked to old Linksys router at family's; yagi antenna hasn't arrived yet). Matt and Luke and Dad came over for lunch. Afterward, Dad helped Sarah with some tax stuff. Luke and I established that we could play LAN games between the houses. Then dad and I cut some old wood for firewood as Sarah and I were out. Tossed it all downstairs. Supper with Sarah, then to bed before work. Cyprian doing well. No teeth yet. Ability to move himself around increasing, though he's only just barely able to decide on a direction and move in it. Says the syllables "ma" and "ba" over and over again sometimes. Rarely drops toys if he doesn't want to.

*** 08 Fri

Cyprian with Mutti today. I went home by way of Wal-Mart and Tractor Supply, but got only milk. Am currently looking for alternative everyday pants. Back home, the yagi antenna arrived, though I couldn't quite figure out how to use it. Worked on my reply to Aaron re: the process of writing poetry, and replied to Nick Strickland re: when we should get together. Slept. In the evening, went to the H family's to get Zippy, and took a bit of extra time to get their printer on the Wi-Fi network (had to switch from TKIP encryption to AES). Went back home, Sarah was there. We cuddled and talked until I had to leave for work again.

*** 12 Tue

Sarah had a full shift today - covering for a co-worker. I did regular stuff at home. In the evening, I went to the little philosophy conference hosted by Nicholas Strickland's wife. I dropped Cyprian off with Mutti and the conference was from 18:00-20:00, and I stayed an extra half hour or so afterwards to chat. The speakers were a Sikh woman, a Buddhist nun, a Christian professor (Chad Meister from Bethel), a traditional Jewish Rabbi, and an atheist (head of some local skeptic or humanist society). I told the nun about Anki, spoke briefly with Prof. Meister, and spoke a little less briefly with Nick and his wife. Got Zippy, came back home, then bed.

*** 14 Thu

Up and at 'em. Put together some prototypes for my makeshift kettlebell. Researched corporal punishment, had lunch at home with Sarah and Elle and Matt, then met Nicholas Strickland at Starbucks in Niles to discuss philosophy and life. Came back home. Took a nap with Sarah on the couch, then went to the H family's and picked up Cyprian, who's still feeling a bit under the weather. Mom was cutting Grandpa H's hair. Mom got a smartphone today. Back home, hung out with Sarah and Cyprian. Had sandwiches for supper. Read some Harry Potter in the evening, before napping prior to work.

* 2016
** 05 May
*** 28 Sat

Played a 6.5 hour game of Talisman with Josh and Ian at the Osbuns' while Sarah painted Gwen's room. Stayed up late doing homework.

*** 29 Sun

Church, then the kids and I napped (Gwen only a little, because she cried until we put Cyprian in another room) at R family's, then we went back to church for Pastor's ordination anniversery (20th?). Saw Maggie and Jon, Hannah, the Grobiens, among others.

*** 30 Mon

Memorial Day. Sarah had the day off. Put animals on Gwen's newly-painted wall. We went to church in the evening, afterwards giving the children to Mom and Dad so we could get hang out with Nick and Hannah. We got frozen yogurt at Let's Spoon then went to the Stuckwisches' house for about an hour.

*** 31 Tue

Took the kids to the park, and Taco Bell, I think. I think this was the first day that Sarah (bottle-)fed the kittens.

** 06 Jun
*** 01 Wed

Suha called to talk with the kids. I took the kids to Lowes (for bathtub patcher), Taco Bell, and the Niles Library, where I got a temporary library card to borrow "Thinking, Fast and Slow" (which I also had just downloaded as an audiobook; I wanted to try reading and listening at the same time).

*** 02 Thu

Vati and Mutti took the kids to the Curious Kids' Museum in the morning. Dad came over and helped me fix both sinks (more or less), and also asked me how I, and I and Sarah, were doing. Matt flew over the house in his new airplane (downpayment a few days ago, I think), the second of which Cyprian and Sarah saw. Luke got home late.

*** 03 Fri

Anna home for a few days. Argued with Mom about something (Anna talking pros of converting to Orthodoxy; no idea how serious). Sarah worked very late, 7ish. Supper at the H family's, followed by Dixit, and bathing the kids at there due to the crack in our bathtub.

*** 04 Sat

Sarah and I decided to make a trip to Europe in a month and a half or so.

*** 05 Sun

Guests at church. Melissa's bridal shower after the service (kids and I napped at R family's). Luke was also at R family's.

*** 09 Thu

Ran in the morning for the first time in a while. Took the kids to Taco Bell and the library in Niles. Sarah and I narrowed down our choices for trip destination to Dublin and Vilnius, and looked at backpacks online.

*** 10 Fri

Took the kids over to the H family's briefly (though no one was home). Dad and Matt and Dad returned from various travels in the evening. Sarah bathed the kids over there (I patched the bathtub today, but it has to dry for 24 hours). We ordered plane tickets to Dublin shortly after midnight.

*** 11 Sat

Very hot. Sarah gardened, took the kids to a greenhouse, painted Cyprian's room, and gardened some more. I mostly worked on Anki stuff (finally regularizing my naming schema etc., adding stuff for the kids, going through some old stuff, and starting work on re-doing my big geography deck). Supper at the H family's (Mom, Dad, Luke), then we all went on a long walk (~1 hour) through the woods. Cyprian finished memorizing the Tem Commandments today, after ~3 days. Sarah made food before we went to bed: treats for tomorrow's Bible Class, and meat for sandwiches for the Family Day after Bible Class.

*** 12 Sun

After Bible Class was family day. Some people helped make banners (Mutti's project) while others played games. I won 2 games of Quarto against Egon, then Leora won a game of Munchkin against me, Matt, Egon, and Julianne.

*** 13 Mon

Found backpack, but not voice recorder or portable hard drive. Sarah put up the train mural in Cyprian's room and I cleaned the cars.

*** 14 Tue

Hot in the morning; felt absolutely awful. Took kids to Niles Library. Made appointment to see Dr. Jones tomorrow morning (Sarah's request). Meant to make appointment for Gwen at Great Lakes Eye, but didn't call in time. Sarah got an offer at Saint Joseph Med Center (part-time, days, float pool), and was given two days to decide. She also got a call from a collections agency (Harris & Harris) which had got one of our bills from Gwen's surgery, which Sarah and I had forgotten about. They threatened to report it on our credit score if we didn't pay by 20:00. I got a free credit report and saw that nothing had been reported yet. I called back and asked for a "validation notice", and was told one was in the mail and would be arriving in about 5 business days.

*** 16 Thu

Dropped the kids off with Mom and went to see Dr. Jones about my recent low energy and moods. He diagnosed me with "situational stress" and mild "reactive depression" and suggested a variety of non-medical treatments (ranging from reading a Psalm a day to seeing a counselor).

*** 17 Fri

Luke passed me during my morning run, and invitied me and the kids over for lunch, which I accepted. After lunch, Luke and I chatted, and I invited him over for supper (rest of H family is gone). Sarah and I 90% decided to accept her job offer from Memorial (as opposed to the one from Saint Joseph, or the one from PACE, where she currently is).

*** 18 Sat

Longest run yet in the morning (though quite slow). Sarah took the kids to the Berrien Springs park, dropping me off at the library. Afterwards, we went to a garage sale across the street from the library and got tons of stuff (clothes, kid books, a barrier to keep Gwen from rolling out of her bed, an old mechanical keyboard, and more). Dad came by for a bit in the evening.

*** 19 Sun

Father's Day. After church, we had lunch at R family's, then hung out a while. Sarah and Mutti got out a kiddie pool and got Gwen to get in and splash around (Cypria absolutely refused to get in). I tried to get one of Vati and Mutti's old printer-scanners to work with my laptop, with no success. We came home and had a nap and then went to the H family's for supper. Then we came back home, put the kids to bed, and Matt and Luke came over to watch them while we went to see Finding Dory at Wonderland Cinema. Around midnight, while Sarah was checking on her kittens, she found an opossum in the barn, presumably eating the kittens' food. We were unable to convince it to leave-it was unconcerned when I poked it with a stick, and Curdie wasn't interested in entering the barn for any reason-but we were afraid it might hurt the kittens if we left it, so I went over to the H family's and woke Matt and Luke up and got Luke to come back with me with his .22. By the time we returned, we couldn't find the opossum anywhere. Luke lent me his gun in case it came back.

*** 20 Mon

Sarah took the Expedition to work. I mostly cleaned during the day. In evening, Aaron Seyboldt and Josh Osbun dropped off Aaron's pickup truck and drove off with our Subaru (we asked to borrow the pickup to get some of the free pews given away by Holy Cross Lutheran Church in Portage, IN). Dad came over and set up a trap in the barn for the opossum.

*** 21 Tue

I took the kids to the Niles Park, Taco Bell, and the library. Felt pretty tired. Got the new tablet (Kindle Fire 7") partially set up while at the library. Did computer work in the evening while Sarah filled out necessary and time-sensitive paperwork online for her new job. I called Samaritan Ministries to get information about how soon we could join (if we decided to). I also called Dr. Pletcher's office to schedule a check-up for Gwen on 24 Friday.

*** 22 Wed

Sarah left early for work. Mutti took the kids from about 09:30 to 14:00. She took them to the Niles park and some restaurant. I went to the Eau Claire library and more or less finished setting up the new Kindle Fire. I made an appointment with Dr. Seifert to see Curdie on 27 Monday, and with Dan Fulkerson to pick up pews (and possibly other furniture) at Holy Cross Lutheran Church on 25 Saturday.

*** 23 Thu

I emailed the PLA guy at Bethel, Tim Ryan, to try to figure out how to get that going. Matt, who had stayed the previous night at the Stuckwisches' due to a storm, came back with Oly, and the two of them made supper for everyone (us, Harrisons, Stuckwisches). Good times. After eating, the grown-ups talked for a bit while everyone else played outside, then everyone went on a big walk in two groups. Cyprian tried to wrap his head around the concept of pretending to shoot pretend people with pretend guns.

*** 24 Fri

Dan Fulkerson called and rescheduled our pew-pickup for next Saturday (the 2nd) instead of tomorrow. Tim Ryan called while I was driving with the kids, so we couldn't talk, but he later emailed me saying he wanted to set up a time to meet at Bethel. I tried to do this today, but didn't get confirmation of babysitting time (from Vati) until after 17:00. I took Gwen (and Cyprian) to an eye check-up with Dr. Pletcher in the morning. It went well, she was fine, and she behaved very well, but it took a long time (about 90 minutes, mostly waiting). Afterwards I took the kids to the Niles Park where, along with regular park activities, I told them some "animal stories" (my second time doing so). I ordered 2 Tom Bihn bags today (Synapse 19 and Synapse 25).

*** 25 Sat

Long run in the morning. Went to garage sales in Berrien Springs with Sarah and the kids, and Mom and Anna today, but didn't get much. Worked on my Anki geo deck a bit, and Sarah was busy with a ton of on-call calls for PACE. After we put the kids to bed, we played a bit of Spelunky, then made a grocery list for tomorrow. I made a plan with Vati to go to Cleveland and help get Naomi moved form the 29th to the 30th. I emailed Tim Ryan to give him my availability for next week.

*** 26 Sun

Mutti wasn't feeling well today, so after church she went home, and we did not join her and Vati for lunch. Instead, we went to Taco Bell (to the kids' delight). Then we went to Aldi and got groceries, then we went home via Fantasy Games (to pick up a Dixit expansion; tonight was Anna's birthday party and she specifically requested that I bring Dixit). Anna's party included Grandma and Grandpa, and all the Harrisons except Elle (who called in for "Happy Birthday"). Anna and Mom made a wonderful (and apparently labor-intensive) meal. After eating, I played Dixit with Anna/Matt/Luke, while Cyprian and Gwen played with the tablet, and everyone else talked. Apparently, Grandma went into an unprecedented amount of detail about her life story.

*** 27 Mon

Took Curdie (and the kids) to the vet. He did exceptionally well, and didn't make a sound even though he got several shots and a blood draw. The kids enjoyed themselves but started to become a nuisance near the end. At home I kind of puttered around, low on executive energy. Sarah came home with leftover pizza from work, and after supper she took the kids to the Niles park. I napped, then worked on my Anki geography maps. After they got back and the kids were put down for bed, Sarah and I exchanged backrubs, ands she tried on her backpacks (2 came in the mail today for her to choose between). She went to bed early while I stayed up way too late working on my geography deck (though making good progress).

*** 28 Tue

Woke up late. Spent all day at home, mostly cleaning. Took kids in the backyard for an hour before naptime. Went to bed early with a very tired Sarah.

*** 29 Wed

Mom came over and took the kids. I drove to Town and Country and gave them the keys. Vati picked me up and we went five or ten minutes before he decided to turn back and go to his office to get battery powered aux in speaker (and more snacks). We drove to Cleveland and spent a few hours with Naomi and the kids. Then it was time for their baseball game. Stereotypically underwhelming. Nick and Beth were there. First time I've seen Nick since the trouble started, and first time I've seen Beth. Nick seemed in a bad mood. Was rude to Naomi, which had an enormously negative effect on her mood. All the kids went with Nick (Naomi next sees them in two weeks) and the three of us (me, Vati, Naomi) went back to her house a did a little packing. I took apart a bed which was shockingly difficult and required a trip to Walmart (for a socket wrench and a hacksaw) and 2-3 hours of work. Got to bed after 1AM.

*** 30 Thu

When we were all up, we started packing. Sarah got the moving truck at about 10AM, then Mutti arrived at about 10:30, then the professional movers arrived at about 11:00. We packed and packed. Naomi was pretty subdued. Professional movers worked for two hours (not including a lunch break) and then left. Near the end, it became obvious that we wouldn't nearly fit everything, so after a lot of back-and-forth, Vati and I went to the nearby Uhaul place and rented an additional trailer. We packed it up, as well as all the cars, and then left for Fort Wayne. Vati drove the Uhaul truck + trailer, I drove Vati and Mutti's little red car, Mutti drove her van, and Naomi drove her van. I stayed with Vati (who had to drive slowly) in case anything happened. At our first rest stop, we were delayed for about an hour by meeting Kermit and Eilene Eck (unsure of spelling). Good conversation. We got to Grandma Uffelman's at about midnight (several hours after Naomi and Mutti arrived). Vati realized that there was frozen food in the deep freezer packed in the truck, so we had to partially unpack it to get the frozen food out and put it in Grandma's freezer. Again got to bed after 1AM.

** 07 Jul
*** 01 Fri

Since Naomi isn't able to move into her new house until ~Friday, we were initially going to just leave everything in the truck (and accept the associated fees). But Don offered to help move the stuff when the time came, so instead we moved everything from the cars and the trailer into Grandma's garage, and everything from the truck into the barn. Don and Amy and Ben (and Emma) helped (of course, Don is the most competent of all of us in such things). Vati and I drove back to Town and Country, stopping briefly at Bargain Books. I picked up the Expedion (after paying the $305 repair) and came back home, met Sarah at the H family's, and had a bit of supper.

*** 02 Sat

Our 5th anniversary. We  bothslept in. In the morning, Sarah took the kids with her when she went to get flowers for church. In the afternoon, we took the kids to the Potowatomi Zoo for Ella McGrath's 2nd birthday party. Then we enjoyed some time at the zoo. In the evening, Mom took the kids while Sarah and I went to The Woodfire.

*** 03 Sun

Church. Sarah felt sick and skipped Bible Class. We had lunch with Vati and Mutti. Came home, napped, had a light supper, then a light cookout with Mom and Dad and Matt and Luke. In the evening, Sarah both shopped for footware online.

*** 04 Mon

went to Eau Claire parade in afternoon, and fireworks in evening; late nap for kids; supper with H family; last time seeing Luke for a bit; Sarah edited mom's chapter for a book

*** 05 Tue

Went to Walmart (got nothing) and then the Niles Library. Sarah and I stayed up sort of late researching healthcare sharing ministries

*** 06 Wed

Stayed home with kids. Did school. Researched healthcare sharing ministries all day. Sarah and I looked at hostels etc. in Ireland in the evening, realized we probably should have booked some stuff already. Sarah somewhat upset. I stayed up far too late, reading about healthcare ministries and working on our Ireland plan (including booking our first two nights at an Airbnb).

*** 07 Thu

Got up at a reasonable time and had one of those weirdly productive days that sometimes follow a night of too little rest. Went to SB and met Vati and Mutti at the Red Table Plaza to see Cindy Berryman's music show for kids (was late due to an enormous amount of road work being done in downtown SB). After leaving the kids with them, I went to PetSmart for a new collar and tag for Curdie, and Joanne's for linen (for travel towels) and elastic (for travel clothesline). Cashiers were quite chatty. Picked up kids. Vati and Mutti then headed to Fort Wayne to start helping Naomi. We made a tentative plan for me (and possibly Sarah and the kids) to spend Saturday in Fort Wayne, helping. Sarah got home early. I payed a car insurance bill which put our total checkings+savings at ~$850 (we're still waiting on the rest of our taxt return, which should come through in about a week according to the IRS website; we also are in the process of returning a few costly items from Amazon etc.). Matt came over with some blackberries and conversation. We had supper with Mom and Dad and Matt. Kids were very ornery. In the evening, I worked on travel plans while Sarah fielded an on-call call and did some laundry.

*** 08 Fri

Cyprian woke up early today. I took the kids to Benton Harbor and went to Animal Control (dog license for Curdie), The UPS Store (return Sarah's scrubs), and the Curious Kids Museum. Spent almost two hours at the museum. Came home and put the kids down for naps. Throughout all of this, they were very active and fussy. Gwen napped a bit and Cyprian approximately none, and then they were up and fussing again. Sarah got home and saved me, and we had supper and bathed the kids and put them to bed. Then we did misc. stuff (computer work, preparation for trip to Ireland, dishes, etc.).

*** 09 Sat

Sarah and I and the kids went to Naomi's new house (first time we'd seen it) and helped with the tail end of the moving-in process. Total in attendance (at various times): us, Naomi, Vati and Mutti, Margaret, Don and Amy and Ben and Emma, Patrick and Emma, Andrew, Oscar Matter, and a woman from Redeemer whose name I forget. A few large pieces of furniture were moved in (and installed, in the case of appliances), the kitchen was cleaned, necessary fixtures were installed in the bathroom, and I put together three beds (with help). Cyprian and Gwen played with Emma Schueler a lot. People left one by one until it was just my little family and Naomi. Putting together the bunk bed was at least an hour's work for me and Sarah. We had both lunch and supper at the house. Water was disconnected, though, so we had to walk to the nearby gas station to use the bathroom. After supper, we went to Grandma Uffelman's and went to sleep.

*** 10 Sun

Packed up and went to Redeemer, then drove home. Sarah and Gwen went to Haley Prahlow's baby shower while I napped (sort of) and watched Cyprian. When they got back, Sarah napped and I took care of the kids until the evening. Misc. computer work after that.

*** 11 Mon

Sarah worked, I took Curdie to the vet, and went to Bethel, giving Vati the kids so I could meet with Tim Ryan. Good meeting. I think this was the day that Sarah's black cat failed to appear.

*** 12 Tue

Sarah's last full day at PACE. I took the kids to the Niles park and library.

*** 13 Wed

Sarah went to work, briefly (to return laptop), and also had her physical for her new job. We spent the rest of the day packing, preparing, etc. Had Matt and (later) Mom and (briefly) Dad over for supper.

*** 15 Fri (start Ireland)

airport, tired, bus to swords, pharmacy, grocery, lunch, castle, walk, betty, sleep, late out, chicken chips salt vinegar onion rings, "all the kids here are bastards, I swear to god", back, tv and chat with betty, lm x2 

*** 16 Sat

Up very late (after 10), breakfast, bus into Dublin. Walked around, went to Trinity College. Good tour. Heard about book organization (by size), graduation order (by grade), and the misogynist provost... good stuff. Saw the Book of Kells. Afterward, ate at Nineteen Ireland or whatever. Had a sort of serious talk. Then walked around some more. Tried to go to park (Someone's Green), but it closed as we arrived. So we wandered a bit, saw a couple of street musicians and a bunch of revelers... fun stuff. Then we found a bus, which took about an hour and a half of wandering and fumbling through my bus-timetable app and Google Maps. Finally we got on one, and got back to Betty's sometime around 11:30. We figured out plans for tomorrow (late morning service at St. Patrick's, then late afternoon train to Cork), then Sarah went to bed, but I stayed up way too late doing junk online.

*** 17 Sun

Up, bye to betty, Dublin, miss bus due to change, late bus, too late for service, tour Christ Church, stop by Catholic church, miss train, lunch in park, train to cork, bus to Kinsale, hostel, dinner, music, bed late after lm and worrying about plans/finances.
Kitty O Se's (where we ate)
Armada Bar (where we heard the music)

*** 18 Mon

Got up lateish and went to the Carmelite Friary for mass. We were by far the youngest people there. Afterwards, we toured the other two churches in Kinsale, including the very old one with the graveyard, and the other one with the oldest functional organ in Ireland. Then we took the Scilly walk, stopped by Hillary Hale's, and arrived at Charles Fort, which we explored for a few hours, and had lunch at (our breakfast/lunch was mostly our leftover bread, apples, and peanut butter). We walked back (stopping again at Hale's to buy a wooden bowl for Vati and Mutti), and got to the bus station with just a few minutes to spare. A very cramped and uncomfortable bus took us to Cork, but we found when we got there that the last bus to Cashel had left fifteen minutes prior. So we quick found a local hostel (Sheila's), checked in, and called the Cashel hostel to tell them we'd be another day (Naomi at the front desk assisted with calling). Then we went out to do a bit of sightseeing (assisted by the impromptu bike historian), and get some supper. This was at Milano's, which turend out to be rather mediocre. Then we went to bed, after I was cornered in the bathroom for a long conversation with the German Apple employee, Sebastian Basti.

*** 19 Tue

Up at a reasonable time, lm. We checked out and skipped breakfast to make the 10am bus to Cashel. Decent bus. Arrived in Cashal and walked around. Saw the tourist office, the old wall... went to SuperValu and bought some food, then ate it near some old house. Saw the John the Baptist church (cathedral?), somewhat in disrepair. Saw the old coffin lids set into the wall. Found our hostel, settled in a bit, then went to the Rock. Tour etc. very interesting. Afterwards checked out the old ruined friary. Then we had supper at the hostel (our provisions), then went to Bru Boru or whatever. Heard songs, sang Brendan, danced, walked back to hostel. Sarah wants to do more singing.

*** 20 Thu

Up, cooked breakfast in hostel, hurried to bus. Bus to Cahir, saw castle there. Bus to Limerick City. Stayed at station. Bus to Galway. Acquired Aran Island Ferries tickets. Saw loads of people in the central park. Got some rum and raisin gilatto (sp?). Shuttle bus to Rossaveal. Ferry to Inishmoor. Went up top a bit, got cold and wet. Got to island. Walked to B&B, brief stop by church. Shown around B&B. Walked to The Bar. Had some good food. First singer was bad, second duo was good. Got cd. we stayed until 23:30. B&B, ml, sleep.

*** 21 Thu

Up at B&B, chat with two other couples from bar. Walked to town, got bikes, biked island. Saw big fort, seal colony, variety of ruins. didn't see megalithic wedge tomb, due to concerns about rain and time. exhausted selves on bikes in rain. talked with rental bike guy about one bag, minimalism, etc. got on ferry, napped up top. got to Galway, went to bar to watch those two guys. Walked to B&B while chatting. nice lady. gave us snacks. were so tired. bed.

*** 22 Fri

Woke up and had a nice Irish breakfast from our stressed host (not as complete as the one on the island, but there was a continental as well, so it was fine). We talked with her briefly. She was sympathetic about our upcoming president (whichever). We took a long bus to Dublin, and went to Dublin Castle and St. Patrick's Cathedral. We stayed a few hours at the cathedral, including going to a brief spoken "evensong". It was all nice, but I was getting pretty tired. Afterward we just wandered the city a bit. We wanted something to eat but didn't know what, and we wanted some traditional music but it was kind of early for that. We wandered around and heard a lot of little bits of stuff but nothing really traditional. Eventually we got some Papa John's, and bused to Artane (after trying to get on the wrong bus first), the neighborhood/whatever where are other Airbnb, Annabelle, was. On the way there we passed a local (non-touristy) pub and heard someone playing/singing Raglan Road. While we deliberated, several people (mostly middle aged women) urged us to go in for a drink. We did. I tried to get on the Wi-Fi to tell Annabelle we'd be a bit late, but I must've copied the password wrong. The pub was packed, and everyone knew each other and it was extremely loud and there were people shouting in our ears trying to make our acquaintances. In particular there was an old (50-70) drunk/crazy guy who went on about how he used to be a jockey, and beat his chest and gave us fist bumps and hit on Sarah pretty hard, and was almost indecipherable through his thick accent and the loud music. We left quickly after we finished Sarah's cider, making the excuse that we had to meet someone (which was true). After we walked out a woman walked after us to make sure that we didn't have the wrong impression of the bar just because of that one guy, who she said was the "biggest asshole" or something. Anyway, we got to Annabelle's about 9:30 PM (we had originally guessed 8-9 PM). We said hi and went upstairs, and then she found that her 2yo son had covered his face with some kind of moisturizing cream or something, so her husband came out to help clean him up while we settled in. Before we went to bed, we mentioned our morning plans (get up before 6, get on bus to airport, get to airport by 7 to make sure we get on our 9 oclock flight). Aidan, Annabelle's husband, said that the buses wouldn't run that early (incorrect), and it'd be better if we used a cab (arguably correct), as we could order it in the morning and sleep confident that it would arrive at the correct time (correct), and since it was just going to the airport it wouldn't be that expensive (incorrect). So he called and ordered us a cab for 6:45 in the morning.

*** 23 Sat (end Ireland)

We got up at about 6:15. I saw on my phone that our flight had been delayed by almost two hours, but we figured we'd go at the time we had planned on going anyway, especially since the cab was already booked. So we left the house at 6:40 (no breakfast) and went to the airport (cost 19 euros. Bus would've been 6 tops.) Waited in line, were told we were in the wrong line, Sarah got upset and started to cry... eventually we made it through the various layers of customs and stuff and were able to peacefully wait for our plane. During the flight to Newark, we watched Midnight Special, then I watched 10 Cloverfield lane while Sarah napped, then she watched Agent Carter while I sort of rested. In Newark, because the plane had been delayed (and our connection wasn't), we literally ran to our next plane and got there just about as our boarding group was called. We watched most of Ant-Man on that flight. At O'Hare, we again literally ran (and took the O'Hare internal rail) to the correct terminal for our bus to South Bend (there was another bus afterward, but we didn't want to wait 2 hours), and we made it within 5 minutes of it leaving. During the bus ride we chatted a bit, Sarah called various parents, we made sure Vati was arriving at the right time, and we listened to some Federalist podcasts and watched some movie trailers. At about 9:15 PM we arrived at the SB airport and Vati picked us up. Back at Vati and Mutti's, we chatted a bit and washed some clothes, then went to bed. (kids were asleep by the time we got there)

*** 24 Sun

I woke up early, at about 5:30. We saw the kids finally (other than when they were asleep last night). Both seem very grown up. Went to church. Extremely hot. I cleaned up litter in the playground during the playground outing during Bible Class. It was filthy. Lots of cigarillo filters. After, we went to Vati and Mutti's for lunch, then drove home. Sarah gave Zip a breathing treatment, as well as treating and bandaging his left hand, where the skin was pretty much coming apart due to his various abuses. We napped, got up, calmed a very itchy scratchy Zippy (his time with Vati and Mutti seems to have exacerbated his skin issues), then had supper with Mom and Dad. Kids were pretty bratty, but it was nice. Mom gave us some food to get us started for the week. We went home and put the kids to bed. Then we did some computer work. Found that today (or maybe yesterday) the remaining ~$3600 of our tax return came through, which is good because we had about $200 left, and a $550 slightly overdue insurance bill. Sarah got ready for her new job.

*** 28 Thu

Supper at the H family's.

*** 29 Fri

Sarah finished her orientation and came home early. Sarah and Zip were sick, I felt slightly sick. Wandered around the house and cleaned a bit. In the evening, Brian and Jill came over and we discussed the book "On the Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness". Sarah and I also discussed politics with Brian.

*** 30 Sat

Everyone kind of sick, except Gwen. So we mostly stayed inside today. Mom came over for lunch. I did a little bit of writing. In the evening, after we put the kids down, Sarah and I watched the first 5 episodes of Parks and Recreation.

*** 31 Sun

Church, then R family's for lunch. Kids kind of sick. We showed pictures of Ireland to Vati and Mutti. Had supper with H family (Dad, Mom, Luke).

** 08 Aug
*** 01 Mon

I dropped the kids off with the Stuckwisches (Monica in charge) and met Nick and Hanna at Nick's new apartment to help him move in. Also present were a number of Stuckwisches, Mummes, and Jindras. We got a load of stuff from Mrs. Jordan's dad's second home, which is nearby and at which Nick had stashed his stuff, and moved it into Nick's place in Irish Hills. Afterwards hung out a bit. I got Nick's internet up and running. Then I went back to the Stuckwisches'. Found that Gwen had already napped, and was hot to the touch and acting very cuddly. Cyprian was happily playing. I stayed at the Stuckwisches' for a few hours, reading their copy of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, with Gwen on my lap. Had supper there, saw Matt and Oly arrive, and then everyone went to church for Vespers, where Sarah also came after her last regular orientation day at Memorial. At church, Sarah took Gwen's temperature and found it in the 103-104 range, so we gave her Tylenol and juice and watched her closely. Back home, Dad took a look at her. Eventually her fever went down and she was pretty much back to normal.

*** 02 Tue

I got up at 4 to drive the H family to the SB airport for their Canada trip. After getting home, I ran, then got the kids up for breakfast, then napped for a few hours while Sarah took over. Later in the day I ordered an Acer R11. Gwen has some sort of rash around her mouth, looks like hand-foot-and-mouth.

*** 03 Wed

Sarah's first regular-orientation day at Memorial. Gwen still has rash around her mouth, and some on her bottom as well. I made an appointment to get Gwen's passport at the Berrien Springs post office tomorrow. Sarah and I watched Parks and Rec before going to bed.

*** 04 Thu

Canceled Gwen's passport appointment, as sores are still visible on her mouth. There are also new sores visible on her feet (or did this happen yesterday?). I went out to get dog food and a few other groceries, and I stoppde by Grandma and Grandpa H's for about an hour.

*** 05 Fri

Sarah worked. Cyprian starting to show signs of hand foot and mouth; is very tired; said that his face hurt. His skin looks awful. Gwen is getting better. Sarah and I watched Parks and Rec. I wrote.

*** 07 Sun

Sarah went to church alone, since the kids have open sores and are contagious (though they seem to mostly feel fine, at this point). She also did some grocery shopping. We all napped in the afternoon.

*** 08 Mon

Sarah worked. I had a quiet day at home with the kids. They're still too contagious to take out. At night, I worked late on my Anki geography deck.

*** 09 Tue

Sarah worked.

*** 10 Wed

Sarah took the kids for a while while I worked on the computer, mostly my Anki geography deck. In the evening, Sarah and I watched Stranger Things and Agents of Shield.

*** 11 Thu

Same as yesterday: Sarah took the kids for a while while I worked on the computer, mostly my Anki geography deck. In the evening, Sarah and I watched Stranger Things and Agents of Shield.

*** 12 Fri

Sarah and I got mostly through our Samaritan Ministries application, pending only Pastor's approval and signature, and our first payment. We grilled for supper, but had to come inside to eat because of all the bugs. Sarah put socks on both of Cyprian's hands. Sarah and I watched Song of the Sea in the evening.

*** 14 Sun

Sarah worked (her first Sunday missed due to Memorial). After church was the picnic and race at Rum Village. Went pretty well. Nick forgot his running shoes, so he took Cyprian (and Vati took Gwen) while I ran. Cyprian had an accident. Kelvin won my age category, and Martin won overall. First time I saw a ropes course being put up at Rum Village. After everyone else left, I stayed with Zip and Gwen for about an hour at the playground, at the end of which Cyprian had another accident. Came home via Taco Bell. Bathed kids at home. Went to bed with Sarah, both very tired.

*** 15 Mon

Sarah worked, I did little. Took the kids to Lowe's and the library. Came home, beat Spelunky, had very late schedule with the kids. Sarah and I went to bed very tired.

*** 16 Tue

I forgot to take care of Nella in the morning. Felt kind of gross. Sarah and I took the kids to the fair. Had a good time, saw lots of animals, etc. Not many familiar faces nowadays. We got some ride tickets for Zip and Gwen, but Gwen got scared so Zip did all the rides (sometimes with a partner, sometimes not. I went on one ride, the big spinning pendulum one. At home, I got Crouton running decently on my new R11. In the evening, Sarah and I watched Stranger Things and Agents of Shield.

*** 17 Wed

Sarah took the kids to the fair while I stayed home. I worked on all three computers at once (my desktop, UL43JC, and R11), and slightly fried my brain. Had some contact with Matt (text) and Luke (call) regarding where they were and when I would pick up Dad and Mom and Matt the following day. Sarah and I watched Stranger Things and Agents of Shield.

*** 18 Thu

Sarah had a short day at work. In the afternoon, I went to the South Bend airport to pick up Dad and Mom and Matt. Their plane was a bit late so I spent some time looking at the military vehicles and rockets on display outside the nearby museum. Drove the family home. In the evening, we brought supper over to their house. Afterwards, Matt watched some Agents of Shield with Sarah and me. Today I got an email from Mutti about Don and Amy's financial troubles.

*** 19 Fri

Sarah worked. In the evening, while the kids were napping, Mom came over to watch them while I went to church for the rehearsal for Kelvin and Melissa's wedding. After the rehearsal, I went to Panera for supper and to work a bit.

*** 20 Sat

Kelvin and Melissa's wedding was at 16:00, and we left at 14:00 to get there at 15:00. I was an usher and stand-in groomsman, along with Nick and Tobias. Then of course there was the reception afterwards, downstairs. It went well, although the kids completely wore Sarah out, including Gwen throwing a number of fits during the reception, and Cyprian having an accident in front of many people in the fellowship hall (no real damage done, though).

*** 21 Sun

Jill Frey joined us in the morning to come to Emmaus with us. She seemed to get a lot out of the service and Bible Class. She also went with us to have lunch at the R family's. Then we came home, and Jill stayed for about an hour to talk about the service, and stuff (mostly with Sarah), before heading home.

*** 22 Mon

Sarah and I disagreed briefly on the use the phrase "Oh my gosh" (and similar) at the lunch table tonight, which eventually become a big conversation in the evening before bed, including Sarah's expectations for me, and whether she shied away from disagreements and debates.

*** 23 Tue

Sarah worked.

*** 24 Wed

I got a Steam Controller in the mail. Played around with it in the afternoon. In the evening, we all went to church. Got back, put the kids to bed, and had supper at home with Dad and Mom and Matt. Afterward, Matt hung around and we watched two episodes of Agents of Shield. Then he stayed and chatted for a bit before going home.

*** 25 Thu

Sarah worked.

*** 26 Fri

Sarah did school with the kids, and mowed the lawn in the afternoon. In the evening, before naps, we walked over to the family's, and discovered that Anna was there (just until tomorrow morning), so we hung out and chatted. Found out also that later that night Eleanor Pettus and her boyfriend were coming by (also just until tomorrow morning), and later on, Elle was arriving (staying for a week and a half).

*** 27 Sat

Had reakfast with the H family, including Elle and Anna, and Eleanor Pettus and her boyfriend Mark (on their way to a wedding). Hung out for a while. The girls talked about their love lives (Stephen Nus took Anna out on a date, but said he just wanted to be friends; Elle seems very enamored of Daniel and has various cute stories about the two of them). Anna left before lunch. Then we came home and napped. Then we went to church for Confession and Absolution. Then went to Aldi for groceries, then came home. Dad and Mom and Elle joined us for supper. Watched some Agents of Shield before bed.

*** 28 Sun

Went to church, chatted with Pr. Osbun and Nick and Sander and Egon. Had lunch with the R family (and Elle), came home and had long naps. Went to the H family's for supper. Watched Song of the Sea with Dad and Mom. Went to bed earlyish.

*** 29 Mon

Sarah worked. I had an okayish day with the kids. Stayed home and did dishes, etc.

*** 30 Tue

Sarah worked. I felt physically okay but mentally very discouraged all morning, dealing with the kids. Felt a bit better during naptime, then took the kids to the H family's for supper. Luke's home, so that was fun. Witnessed a medium-length, unproductive theological discussion between Luke, Mom, Elle, and Dad. Hung out with the family a bit after supper, played some Bananagrams, then went home and put the kids to bed. Hung out with Sarah a bit before she went to bed. I stayed up a bit later because I wasn't tired yet. Read through the first part of Alena's "The Dragon King", and pretended to start and the second draft of Ethan's "Three Weeks".

*** 31 Wed

I worked downstairs in the morning while Sarah did school with the kids, then we had Dad and Mom and Elle and Luke over for lunch. Skirted the edges of a political discussion. Then Elle took the kids while Sarah and I went to St. Joseph and talked with Becky, our financial advisor. Afterward we walked along the beach, saw some wind surfers, and went to the end of the left-side pier (the ride-side pier, with the lighthouses, was visibly unsafe, with big sand-filled waves rolling over it). Then we walked back and somewhat on the spur of the moment decided to see the movie "Florence Foster Jenkins" at the local Celebration! Cinema. Funny and sad movie. Then we had a brief-ish supper at a Chinese buffet before coming home. On the way home, we made a plan with Naomi and Margaret to come visit tomorrow.

** 09 Sep
*** 01 Thu

Drove to Fort Wayne in the morning. Met Maggie at her place (first time I'd seen it), then went over to Naomi's place (Naomi had just gotten back from picking up Sammy). Hung out and had lunch. Later on Jonathan arrived (after work), then Naomi picked up Saranita and Susan. The kids all got along really well together, especially Cyprian and Sammy. After supper, we all went to Redeemer for a brief Divine Service (during which Gwen it particular was very cranky). Then we said goodbye and headed home. Got home late-ish and went to bed.

*** 02 Fri

Sarah took the kids in the morning while I worked downstairs, mostly scanning documents. I think we might have had the H family over for lunch. We all napped in the afternoon, then went over to the H family's for supper. Grandma and Grandpa Harrison were there, too. After supper we went downstairs and I showed pictures of Ireland, and then Luke showed pictures of Washington (where he went climbing with Reuben). I spent 30-60 minutes prior to the pictures getting them ready on my Chromebook, and I felt pretty stressed out by the end of it. We went home with the kids fairly late, and I barely made it through bedtime and devotions before going to bed early.

*** 03 Sat

Got up at a reasonable time with Sarah. She sent me on a run while she and Cyprian made waffles. Got home, had waffles, and worked downstairs, mostly organizing digital photos. After lunch, we picked up Dad and went to Berrien Springs (meeting Grandma and Grandpa Harrison there) for a blacksmithing demonstration, and looking at the museum and log cabin. I came primarily to run errands, which didn't work out so well because Village Hardware, Apple Valley, and the library were all closed. But I got a few things at Hardings and met everyone else in the park/museum area near the library. When we got home, we put the kids down for nap and Sarah cut up tomatoes (her garden is producing tons of them) while I did dishes. Then we went over to the H family's for supper. Luke was absent, as he was camping in the woods with Joshua Jordan (and Ariksander, I think). We did see them briefly when they came back to get goggles for Airsoft. Dinner was nice but we were all a bit tired and antisocial so we came home, bathed the kids, played some Spelunky, and put them to bed. After that, Sarah and I watched the last two episodes of Stranger Things, and one episode of Agents of Shield, before we went to bed.

*** 04 Sun

Got up a bit late, but got to church in time. After church, went to Javier's Bistro with Mom and Dad and Vati. Then we went to the Michiana Celtic Festival (first time after years of trying). Let the kids play in the playground for a while before we actually went in. Watched some hurling, some haggis-tossing, saw the booths, listened to the music... it was pretty enjoyable. After a while we went back out, let the kids play on the playground some more, and then left. Just before we left I took Cyprian to the bathroom (in the nearby rec center), and on the way out a woman cursed at us. As we were driving away, Sarah and I saw the same woman walking past us, holding her middle finger high in the air, apparently flipping off anything and everything. We suspect she was not mentally stable. We left and went briefly by Vati and Mutti's to drop off some banana bread for Vati (as well as the black socks I borrowed for the Rodriguez wedding), then we went home. We were all kind of tired, but Sarah made a nice supper before we all went to bed.

*** 05 Mon

Worked downstairs while Sarah held down the fort upstairs. Went to the H family's for lunch. Got a good video of Cyprian singing "Bimbombey" at the piano. Got home and did more work, much of which was repairing the video, which my phone corrupted somewhat. Had the H family over for supper, and Suha, who had only just returned. After supper, Elle and Luke stayed for a bit to talk. Mostly it was Luke philosophizing about people out west, work, and his upcoming time at Augustine. After they left and we put the kids to bed, Sarah showered and went to bed early (in preparation for work), although she had trouble falling asleep, getting up twice to acquire or enact various sleep aids (a hot pack, a familiar book, and a carb snack). I worked slightly late.

*** 06 Tue

Sarah worked. I had a good morning with the kids; did school with them, etc. Then after lunchtime I started to feel very tired. Took the kids to the H family's for supper. I was exhausted when Sarah came home, and we both went to bed earlyish.

*** 07 Wed

I woke up still pretty tired. Sarah sent me on a run. Pr. Stuckwisch came by at 10:00 to talk (briefly) about Sarah and me, and (more in-depth) about Cyprian and first communion. He put Sarah at ease and we all agreed that we'd get ready for Cyprian to take first communion soon. Cyprian seemed pretty excited about it. I spent the entire afternoon and evening organizing pictures downstairs; Sarah and the kids napped, and then went to Silver Beach. We watched some Agents of Shield before going to bed.

*** 08 Thu

Worked downstairs. Sarah took the kids on some errands, then in the afternoon she and Luke cleaned up the barn in preparation of Dad putting on a new roof. Sarah made pizza for supper and Luke and Suha joined us. After putting the kids to bed, we watched an episode of Agents of Shield before going to bed.

*** 09 Fri

Sarah worked. I got up early, after Cyprian woke me up for the bathroom. Felt pretty good, actually. Suha took the kids in the morning, and I did computer stuff. The original plan for the evening was for Luke to watch the kids while I went to Vati's opera, possibly taking Suha if she was interested. But she wasn't, and Luke was, so he went with me while she watched the kids again. Had good talks with Luke to and from Bethel; talked about climbing, life, plans, etc. He's still struggling with whether to join the military. The opera went well. Cecilia Horner was in it, and she did a good job. Everything else went fine, with one exception: while Suha was watching the kids here at home, Cyprian opened the back door for Curdie and left it open for a while, letting it tons of mosquitoes. Suha ran around with the zapper getting a bunch of them, but there are still a lot left, and I spent a good 20-30 minutes before bed killing them in the bathroom, hallway, and laundry room.

*** 10 Sat

Sarah worked. I spent the first half of the day very tired; felt like I barely got through. Second half wasn't as bad, though. Cyprian's doing tolerably well with his math. Gwen is covered with mosquito bites, but doesn't seem to notice. Cyprian is excited about his upcoming first communion (it was the only thing he said thank you for at bedtime prayers). In the evening, Matt called briefly to check in (as the rest of the family is rather indisposed). Sarah and I watched an episode of Agents of Shield.

*** 11 Sun

Sarah took a low census day. Suha rode with us to church. No Harrisons in the congregation today. I chatted with Nick after church, about Agents of Shield, and D&D. After Bible Class was the church family day, which consisted of new photos for the church directory (Sarah and I declined, since Gwen's face is still covered in mosquito bites), and a big game of Bingo. I helped Cyprian play a bit, and Sarah helped Gwen, then I took the kids to the youth room and watched them while they played until we were all ready to go. We went home and all napped. I think Suha came over for supper.

*** 12 Mon

Woke up very tired, with sore legs. Figured out later that I was just sick. Spent much of the day working downstairs, scanning etc. Sarah picked up two kittens from a co-worker in South Bend today. Brought them back and got them set up in Curdie's old cage on the back porch. Mom is back, and she and Dad joined us for supper. Sarah and I watched the last two episodes of the first season of Agents of Shield.

*** 13 Tue

Sarah took Cyprian for a check-up with Dr. Lello, as well as some vaccinations. Sarah was rather upset after the appointment, due to having had to wait for an hour to even see Dr. Lello, and for comments by Dr. Lello which seemed to Sarah to be questioning her parenting ability. After lunch, the kids and Sarah napped, and I cleaned my office. After supper, Sarah went to South Bend to be present at a church council meeting.

*** 14 Wed

Sarah worked. I took the kids to the Niles Library, then went to Taco Bell, then came home via Hardings. Did school with them.

*** 15 Thu

Sarah worked. I stayed home with the kids all day. Hard to find motivation. Did take the kids outside to play with the kittens. When we went to bed, I suddenly felt wide awake, and went into the living room to read for a few hours before returning to bed.

*** 16 Fri

In the morning, we went to Mishawaka. Sarah dropped me off at JCPenny's, where I bought a black suit for Nick and Hannah's wedding. Sarah meanwhile picked up Walter Sanders and took him to a doctor's appointment. Then Sarah picked me up, and we picked up Walter's prescription, and then dropped Walter off at his house. Then, since we were very near Bethel, Vati joined us for lunch at Fazoli's. Afterwards we drove home and all napped. After we put the kids to bed, Elle came over and we all watched Iron Man. After Elle left, Sarah and I stayed up late choosing races and classes for our DnD characters.

*** 17 Sat

Went to Mishawka to check out the Emmaus Port-a-Pit chicken sale, and pick up our chickens. I chatted with Matthew Horner a bit about Futurama (he's still working his way through the original series). We were prepared to offer one or both of our services to help out, but they had enough help. So we went and had lunch with Vati and Mutti at Mrs. Jordan's father's extra house (where Vati and Mutti are staying for the weekend while they rent out their house to Notre Dame game-watchers). First time we've seen Mutti since her trip to Taiwan. We had lunch and chatted, then Sarah and I went to Aldi for groceries. Then we all went home. Shortly after unloading and putting away all the groceries, Nick arrived. We spent an hour or two chatting, then having supper, then we got to worked setting up my and Sarah's characters for our upcoming DnD game. Nick left at about 2200.

*** 18 Sun

Church, voter's meeting, lunch with Vati and Mutti (pizza on the patio), Mutti and Gwen drew with chalk (Gwen wanted a picture of Matthew). Home, nap, supper with H family (including Grandma and Grandpa Harrison). Watched Agents of Shield before going to bed.

*** 19 Mon

Sarah worked. I took the kids to the Niles park and library. Spent a long time at the library; too long, as we were all tired and hungry by the end of the trip. Gwen was befriended by (and scared of) a youngish girl named Lilianne. In the evening, Sarah discovered that one of the two kittens (Pepper) had been taken by an owl (which she saw leaving the yard). She put the other kitten (Paprika) in the mudroom for the night.

*** 20 Tue

Sarah cleaned all day while I worked downstairs. Mom called around lunchtime to say that her laptop had died and she was heading to Best Buy to buy a new one. Sarah headed her off and told her to talk to me. She did, and I ordered her an Asus TP200SA (along with an external DVD burner and 128GB mini flash drive). Then I spent the rest of my time downstairs with her big laptop (which turned out to be more or less fine, after letting all the updates go through, etc), backing up her data. I lent her my own Ul43Jt (or whatever) so she could continue work in the meantime.

*** 21 Wed

Bit of work in the morning. Sarah got frustrated with the (very ornery) kids. Sarah and I went to St. Joseph (Mom watched the kids) to meet with Becky Young about a recent law affecting IRAs. We had some extra time, so we also stopped at Goodwill to donate some old stuff, and Walmart to buy some misc. items. While we were gone, Mom's laptop arrived (she had payed for 1-day shipping), as well as a bunch of misc. stuff I had ordered. Sarah fixed up an old rabbit cage for Paprika so she could stay outside but not be owl-accessible. In the evening, Sarah read to me ("Lilith") while I did a bunch of dishes and made some protein shakes for tomorrow.

*** 22 Thu

Ran in the morning while Sarah did school with the kids. Misc work. Sarah mowed. We had Mom and Suha over for supper. Played some Spelunky with the kids. Cyprian had two accidents today, both because he put off going to the bathroom because he was having fun doing something else.

*** 23 Fri

Sarah was called off, and then called back in at about 10:00. Suha took the kids for the morning and first bit of the afternoon. She also invited us (me and the kids) over to the H family's for supper, where we also met her friend from Travers City, Alisha. Suha and Alisha served a nice Indian-ish meal. Grandpa and Grandma Harrison were there, too.

*** 24 Sat

Sarah worked. I took the kids to the Niles library in the morning. Short-ish visit, as the kids (and I) seemed rather low-energy. At home, Matthew came by for literally a minute to say hi and bye. I did practise CLEPs. The only other thing was Brian's surprise 30th birthday party, which I ended up not going to, mainly because it was late and I'd have to take the kids.

*** 25 Sun

Church, lunch with Vati and Mutti. I went by Staples briefly to look at computer shoulder bags (I bought nothing). Then we went home and napped (more or less). Kids were kind of a handful in the evening; Mom and Suha came over for supper. Before bed, we watched some Agents of Shield (we're still in the early episodes of season 2). Just before we went to sleep, Sarah realized that she's scheduled to work this coming Sunday, which is when Cyprian's first communion (as well as some other stuff) is. Tomorrow she'll see if there's any way out of that.

*** 26 Mon

Sarah worked. I did CLEPs. Gwen had some trouble with constipation. Sarah asked at work if there was anyone who could take her shift this Sunday. Got three leads, followed one, which was negative. Will follow the others tomorrow. In the evening, we watched the second half of the first Trump/Clinton debate. Then we both had to comfort and clean up Cyprian, who had a nightmare and wet the bed. Then I went for a late run before going to bed.

*** 27 Tue

Up late ish. Dad came by and mentioned that he was in a bad accident recently. He's fine, but the red Insight rolled a few times and is completely totalled. I worked downstairs; Sarah took the kids outside. At one point, Cyprian got sand in his eye, and I had to hold him down while Sarah squirted saline in his eye. I spent a while organizing pictures and songs on the computer. I tried on my new suit for Nick's wedding. I started planning the next book discussion ("The Iron Ring" by Lloyd Alexander). Sarah and I took a walk with the kids in the evening. At some point today, Sarah made contact with one of her co-workers, and was able to trade shifts, ensuring that she could be present for Cyprian's first communion on Sunday.

*** 28 Wed

I ripped about half of our audio CDs.  Went to bed earlyish with Sarah.

*** 29 Thu

Cyprian was up several times during the night, and wet the bed in the morning (third time in a few days, I think). I copied more CDs, and wrote an email to Ethan. Sarah did a bunch of work outside. I and Zippy went to Eau Claire for some misc. hardware and groceries, and straw bales for Sarah. We also very briefly visited Mom in her new office. Instead of running, I took a nap. We went over to the H family's for supper (with Mom and Dad and Elle), then came back home and, after putting the kids to bed, played Catan with Elle and Dad (Elle won by a lot).

*** 30 Fri

I took the kids to Mutti at the beginning of the day, chatted with her a bit (got some news about Pr. Grobien and Pr. Petersen separately pursuing action against Pr. Kavouras), then went to the locksmith on Miami Street. Got some spare keys made, but not the main ones I came for (the Expedition), since it turns out that only Mike can program them, and he's not usually at the shop. Then I went to Menards and got some painting stuff for Sarah (and almost got some indoor/outdoor carpet; they didn't have enough of the cheap stuff). Then I went to Bethel and ran on one of the treadmills. After this I wandered around the campus, feeling nostalgic, then went to the library and wrote my first proper subjective journal (which Dr. Jones assigned me ages ago to be doing). Then I went to church (Vespers with catechetical examination), then stopped at Vati and Mutti's a bit more, then came home.

** 10 Oct
*** 01 Sat

Sarah worked.

*** 02 Sun

Big day at church. First communion for Cyprian, and Cecilia Osbun; baptism for David Sams; and confirmation for a bunch of people, including Kelvin. Then a little party at Vati and Mutti's before we came home.

*** 03 Mon

Got up early and went to South Bend. Got extra keys made for the Expedition, and chatted with Mike, the locksmith. Went to Bethel and took my first two CLEPs (Intro to Management and Intro to Marketing). Then ran on a treadmill there before coming home. Mom and Dad came by for supper. Sarah and I watched some Agents of Shield before going to bed.

*** 04 Tue

Sarah worked. Quiet-ish day with the kids. Very good behavior for the morning, normal behavior afterwards. Gwen missed out on the second half of her supper when she threw it on the floor. Sarah and I watched the vice presidential debate (Tim Kaine and Mike Pence) before going to bed.

*** 05 Wed

Went to Bethel and passed two CLEPs (Humanities and Information Systems). Meanwhile, Mutti took a walk with Mom, then took the kids for the day (also dropped Sarah off in Mishawaka). After I was done with my tests I went to Vati's office and chatted with him for about an hour (he showed me a bunch of the videos he had made for last year's online class). Sarah went boot shopping and then met me at Vati's office. We went to the athletic center and did some cardio together. Then we dropped off a package at a UPS Store (scrubs that Sarah was returning), then we went to Hacienda for a late lunch. After that, we drove to South Bend and walked along the river for half an hour before going to church for Evening Prayer (and to take the kids from Mutti). After we got home, Suha came over, and she and Sarah started planning a canoeing/camping trip for the Emmaus young adults. They tentatively set it for Nov 11-12, conflicting with Josh's plan to have a Talisman game that day. Stay tuned for further developments.

*** 06 Thu

Sarah was called off, so she spent the day at home, taking care of the kids, while I worked downstairs. I made a bunch of progress with organizing music, and good progress (finally) on Anki for myself and the kids, and that's about it. Sarah and I watched an episode of Agents of Shield before going to bed.

*** 07 Fri

Sarah worked. 

*** 08 Sat

Sarah took the kids apple picking. I worked downstairs, mostly ripping CDs and working on maps for Anki. Sarah took Paprika to the vet. Before bed, Sarah and I settled on "The Keeper" as our song for the talent show tomorrow, and practiced it a bunch of times.

*** 09 Sun

Church, then the talent show. Gerhardt did crochet; Kelvin sang a Spanish song; Leora (who turned 16 today) showed pictures of anthropomorphic cats, etc.; and Josh read "The Three Little Cajun Pigs". Then we came home (stopping briefly at Vati and Mutti's to pick up a spare cage Mutti had lying around, for use with Paprika). In the evening, we had Grandma and Grandpa H (and Mom) over for supper. Grandma agreed to take care of Paprika while we're gone at the wedding. The second presidential debate was today, but Sarah and I watched Agents of Shield instead. Mutti's trip to Ethiopia is delayed, probably by a lot, due to a six-month period of national emergency.

*** 10 Mon

Sarah worked. I ordered (with one-day shipping) a new FM transmitter for the car, and the gift (immersion blender) for Nick and Hannah.

*** 11 Tue

Sarah worked. I watched the kids. In the evening, Elle watched the kids for an hour and a half while I went to Benton Harbor for Staples (printing some Two Rooms and a Book cards) and Walmart (misc. stuff).

*** 12 Wed

Took Curdie to Paws-N-Claws kennel. Then Sarah took Paprika to Grandma H. Then we spent a few hours packing the kids, then left for Wisconsin. King of an annoying drive, with lots of rain and construction. Got to Ethan and Karen's, hung out until about 2 before going to sleep.

*** 13 Thu

Spent day with Ethan and Karen (except for the hours Karen was at school). We all walked to a little nearby playground, where Zip and Gwen had a lot of fun and got pretty tired. The kids got into a bit of mischief while "napping", first opening all of Sarah's sanitary pads, then getting into the markers and drawing on themselves. Eventually Sarah went into their room to nap with them. I played a bit of Halo Anniversery with Ethan, and otherwise just talked with him. I gave him updates on Maggie. We also discussed Aaron a bit. Another late night.

*** 14 Fri

We had breakfast with Ethan and Karen, then drove to Waterville, MN. We checked into the little motel, then went to the church for the rehearsal, which went well, as rehearsals generally do. Then there was dinner, and line dancing; the kids started getting pretty fussy, so during the line dancing we went back to the motel and, after things were pretty settled, I went back to join the other groomsmen etc at the bachelor's party. I played Smash-Up with Ariksander, Stephen Nus, and Andrew Casey, next to another game of Smash-Up that included Nick, Zack Stuckwisch, Oscar, and,,, I forget. A game of Munchkin also was going, with Matthew Horner, Caleb Smith, Nate Mumme, and another boy whose name I forget. Tobias seemed pretty tired and mostly napped, and a few other people (Matters or Mummes or such) came and went. After the games were done, several people left, including Nick and Zack. I spent several hours discussing books, movies, and superheroes with Oscar, Ariksander, Stephen, and Matthew, while Andrew and Caleb had their own discussion (I heard swords/martial arts, politics, and working-at-Starbucks discussed). Tobias was also there, but he seemed to be trying to sleep the whole time. On the way back to the motel, I tried to find someplace to stop to get breakfast food for the morning, but everything was closed.

*** 15 Sat

Sarah and I took the kids to McDonald's for breakfast, then got to the church just a little bit late. The whole morning and part of the afternoon, five or six hours, was given over to some very meticulous and carefully-planned picture-taking. There were getting-ready pictures, cufflink pictures, groomsmen pictures, bridesmaid pictures, individual pictures, etc. During the longest down-time, an hour or so immediately prior to the service itself, while people finished lunch, I joined in a conversation with Oscar, Stephen, Andrew, Maggie and Jon, and I think some input by Caleb, Zack, and Nick. We talked about physics, especially relativistic physics and theoretical physics. Also Star Wars. Then there was the wedding itself, which went swimmingly. Then the reception, which also went well. Sarah and I managed to get in a decent amount of dancing, even though the kids were pretty tired; the dancing was exciting enough that they both got into it for a bit and had a lot of fun. Sarah and I got to chat with Paul Gehlbach for a bit. By the time we left, Cyprian was telling me repeatedly that he was "exhausted". We also suspect, based on his bathroom trips and complaint that his butt hurt, that he's constipated. Poor guy. We got back to the motel and got settled in and went to bed..

*** 16 Sun

We got up, packed, and went to church in Waterville. Saw everyone, including Nick and Hannah (who came in just before the service started and sat with us). Afterward we all went downstairs and had lunch, and Nick and Hanna proceeded to open wedding presents. Around 15:00, Sarah and I and the kids left and drove home. It was a long drive, with a lot of stops for Cyprian to pee. Also, Gwen puked all over herself about halfway through. We got home shortly after 01:00, I think.

*** 17 Mon

Recovery day. I don't think we did much today.

*** 18 Tue

Sort of another recovery day. I worked downstairs while Sarah did stuff with the kids and mowed the lawn. In the evening, we had Elle and Anna and Suha (and Mom?) over for supper, and then we all played Dixit. Then Suha left, and Elle and Anna chatted with us for a while (mostly Elle talking about Daniel etc.).

*** 19 Wed

Sarah worked. I took the kids to the Berrien Springs park and library (and Hardings). Late-ish schedule all around, and I felt just sort of sick all day. Hard to focus on things. After Sarah got home, we chatted a bit, then she went to bed and I worked downstairs (on music CDs).

*** 20 Thu

Sarah worked. I let the kids have probably too much tablet and movie time while I worked on CDs and stuff.

*** 21 Fri

Sarah worked. Suha took the kids in the morning. Daniel arrived in the afternoon. I mostly worked on CDs downstairs. I also did a lot of dishes and laundry I took the kids to the H family's for supper (and to meet Daniel). Sarah and I watched Agents of Shield before going to bed.

*** 22 Sat

We had breakfast and lunch at the family's, so we could hang out with Daniel. Sarah's first time meeting him. The kids took to him pretty well. He showed Mom and I how to play Cribbage. 

*** 23 Sun

Church - first Sunday with Nick and Hannah. We chatted about the Farseer Trilogy after the service. There was also a bake sale. Daniel was present, too. After the service, we went straight back home, to have lunch with the family before Daniel left in the afternoon.

*** 24 Mon

Went to Bethel and passed two CLEPs (Human Development and Educational Psych). Then I ran on a treadmill (while watching Black Mirror episode 2). Only ran for half an hour, as I started to feel very tired. Mutti called and we tentatively set a plan for her to come watch the kids this Thursday. Then I went to Aldi and got groceries, then I came home. Elle and Mom came over for supper. Sarah and I watched some Agents of Shield before going to bed.

*** 25 Tue

Sarah went to Memorial in the morning for some kind of recertification while I stayed home with the kids. Dad came over and started working on putting the new roof on the barn. Sarah got back, we all had lunch, then I went out with Dad and we finished about half of the roof. Dad left for a meeting at work, and Sarah and I and the kids and Suha had supper. Before going to bed, Sarah and I watched some Agents of Shield (S02E21-22).

*** 26 Wed

Very rainy. Did a bit of work inside the barn with Dad, then watched the kids while Sarah worked in the barn.

*** 27 Thu

Dad came early to work on roof. Sarah and I went to the optometrist. We came back and worked on roof, eventually finished. Sarah read to me while I did dishes.

*** 28 Fri

Suha took the kids today, and Dad took them both on long walks (Cyprian came back with some scratches and pokes from the forest). I played Nuclear Throne and bought music and movies on MediaSack. In the evening we had a casual "surprise" party for Dad's 57th birthday (tomorrow). Grandma and Grandpa H were there, as were Sue and Rick (recently returned from Indonesia or somewhere) and Anna (after another hour - car trouble on the way) and Matt (after about two hours - side trip to surprise visit Oly) and Sarah (after another hour - she worked today). We stayed until about 21:30, talking.

*** 29 Sat

Sarah worked. Suha took the kids again today. In the afternoon, while I was running, Elle called and asked if she could use our oven (theirs had stopped working and she was making food for Nick and Hannah's second reception tomorrow). I said yes. I got home at about the same time that Suha and Anna were bringing the kids back. Elle stayed for about an hour, baking.

*** 30 Sun

Sarah was scheduled to work today, but she was called off early in the morning. We took both cars to church since she was on-call. After Bible Class was Nick and Hannah's second reception. It went well. Nick and Hannah (in their wedding attire) sat at the head of the fellowship hall and people congratulated them. Afterwards, we drove home and napped. In the evening, Matthew and Elle came over and chatted and watched some Agents of Shield with us. Matthew left to 

*** 31 Mon

Sarah and Cyprian took Paprika to a vet appointment. Then they went to Lowe's and Rural King for a few barn-related items. In the afternoon, I worked downstairs while Sarah worked with the kids outside. We all went to church in the evening for All Saints.

** 11 Nov
*** 01 Tue

At about midnight, Sarah had sudden acute pain in her abdomen. After about half an hour, we called Mom over. She was concerned about possible ovarian torsion, so Elle came and watched the kids while I loaded Sarah in Mom's car and the three of us drove to Lakeland. By the time we got there, Sarah felt significantly better, so we came home and went back to sleep. At 3:30 or so, the pain came back, and Mom drove us to Lakeland again and we went to the ER. Sarah had an ultrasound. The doctors thought it was probably a ruptured cyst, but there was still a possibility of ovarian torsion. They didn't do a CT scan because they said it wouldn't really add any information. They tentatively scheduled Sarah for laparoscopic surgery at 15:00. I went home for a few hours to watch the kids while Elle went to work. Then I went back (Elle said she was okay with staying with the kids overnight). While I was gone, Pr. Stuckwisch came by to visit and pray with Sarah. She eventually did have surgery, somewhere between 18:00-20:00 (I forget exactly). Sarah and I watched Agents of Shield together in the pre-surgery waiting area. Then the surgery lasted about an hour, and she was in recovery for another hour before I could go and see her (Mom and Dad left after Dr. Proctor came to report the surgery's success to us). The surgery went well; no torsion, but lots of blood and adhesions, and the ruptured cyst, all taken care of. Sarah was super groggy from narcotics. Eventually we managed to lave the hospital at about 22:30, and came home, stopping at Walgreens for her pain meds, and some post-op-friendly foods (pudding and such). Got home at midnight.

*** 02 Wed

Sarah in recovery. Cubs won the World Series for the first time in over 100 years.

*** 03 Thu

Sarah in recovery. In the evening, I took the kids to a little Halloween party at Emmaus hosted by Elizabeth Gleason. The other people in attendance were some Tribbles (Rita, Egon, Bekah, and Leora) and some Stuckwisches (Monica and Ariksander). Very modest. Elizabeth seemed to have a good time. The kids were entertained with bouncy balls, snacks, and the tablet.

*** 04 Fri

Sarah in recovery. 

*** 05 Sat

Sarah in recovery. We had initially scheduled a canoe trip for today; it eventually was scaled down to a cookout-and-games day at our house, which was almost canceled due to Sarah's surgery. Eventually it turned into Ian and Elle and Anna coming over, and we just played games together (Cosmic Encounter, Antidote, and Smash Up). I became very tired around supper time, but had a bit of caffeinated tea, kind of as an experiment, and felt better. After getting the kids to bed, Jill Frey came over and we (me, Sarah, Elle, Ian, and Jill) discussed The Iron Ring.

*** 06 Sun

Sarah in recovery. Church. Sarah slept through Bible Class. Phil Bergt is back in South Bend. After church, Sarah and I took the kids to Rum Village for a picnic and playground times. Supper was at the H family's, but I felt very tired and mainly just wanted to sleep. Sarah and I spent a bit of time going over her schedule for the next few weeks.

*** 07 Mon

Got up feeling pretty decent - both me and Sarah. I worked downstairs while Sarah took the kids. In the afternoon, we started putting up the clear plastic siding on the barn. In the evening, Elle watched the kids while we went out for Sarah's birthday, to the Wood Fire. Then we took a leisurely walk around Dowagiac. We had considered going to see Dr. Strange, but decided to see it on Friday with Nick and Hannah (and some other people). So instead we came home and, after chatting with Elle, watched some Agents of Shield.

*** 08 Tue

Election day. Sarah worked on the barn all day while I watched the kids. We voted (both of us for Evan McMullin). Trump was announced the winner a little after midnight, I think.

*** 09 Wed

Sarah worked. I took the kids to the Niles park and library and Taco Bell. Cyprian interacted with boy his age named Jason at the library.

*** 10 Thu

Sarah worked. I took the kids to the Berrien Springs library, and I made cookie dough for the Talisman game on Friday.

*** 11 Fri

Sarah and I went to see Dr. Strange in the evening, along with Nick and Hannah, Matthew and Erik, Josh and Sarah, Ariksander and Justinian and Monica, Aaron, and Nick's old boss (not totally sure about that list). Good movie. Suha watched the kids during. Afterward, Sarah and I got supper at a gyro place in Mishawaka, and talked about the movie and stuff.

*** 12 Sat

"I got up slightly early and baked cookies. Then we all got in the car. Sarah dropped me off at the Osbuns' for Talisman, then went with the kids to Vati and Mutt's, where she had lunch. Then she left the kids there and went to see Anne of Green Gables (the play) at Bethel with Elle, Aunt Susan, and Grandma H (it's Grandma's favorite book). Then Grandma took them out for ice cream. After that, she picked me up, then the kids, then we went home.

Talisman went well. There were so many people we split it into two games: a game with just the newest expansion, Cataclysm, played by Josh, Ariksander, Ian, and Doug, Josh's friend; and a game with little more than the base game, played by me, Sarah Osbun, Nick, Hannah, and Matthew Horner. I was the Swashbuckler, then the Grave Robber, then the Warlord, but we all lost to Nick's Dragon Rider. Josh won the other game."

*** 13 Sun

We went to church. Pastor Stuckwisch was out of town, so Pastor Seyboldt preached, and did Bible Class. Sarah and I made a plan with Nick and Hannah for them to hang out at our house on Thursday. After Bible Class, Sarah and I and the kids had lunch at Vati and Mutti's, and I left my laptop at their house to download movies purchased on MediaSack, and Mutti sent with me the cheap Windows laptop she got, so I could try to fix a minor issue. In the evening, we went to Mom and Dad's for supper. Suha spent the evening at the Horners'.

*** 14 Mon

Sarah was scheduled to work, but got a mandatory call-off. So she spent the day working on the barn with Dad (I also came out briefly to help with some heavy lifting). I watched the kids, with long breaks when first Mom, then Suha took them both on walks. Cyprian ate a lot at every meal today (a lot for him, at least). We had Mom and Dad over for lunch, and we had supper at their house, along with Elle. Supper was very nice, and afterward, Elle played with the kids a lot. In the evening, Sarah and I watched The Boxtrolls, on Margaret's recommendation. Weird movie.

*** 15 Tue

It was kind of a bleary day, and we all woke up a little grumpy, so we decided we could at least be productive. We drove to South Bend and ran a bunch of errands: first we dropped the Subaru off at Town & Country Auto to have it checked out (we ended up getting $600 worth of essential repairs, and foregoiong another $1200 of non-essential repairs), then Sarah dropped me and the kids off at Vati and Mutti's house (where I worked on the computer while the kids played, alternately, with Mutti, each other, toys, the tablet, and finally just watched a movie). We ended up staying for a long time while Sarah bought paint for the barn and went to Goodwill and majorly restocked us with kids' winter clothes. After she picked us up from Vati and Mutti's, we went by Aldi for a small grocery run. Then we came home. We had supper with Mom and Elle.

*** 16 Wed

In the morning, Sarah went to her surgery follow-up with Dr. Proctor. Good visit: everything's fine, we got a discount on the bill, and Dr. Proctor confirmed that it was not a pre-existing condition, so Samaritan should pay for it all. I did school with the kids while Sarah was gone. When she got back, I went downstairs and worked (another long music organization session) for a few hours. I also re-wrote my backstory for my first D&D character (Lexacorugin). I went on a run just before supper. Sarah and I played some games before going to sleep.

*** 17 Thu

Sarah and I spent the day cleaning the house, getting supper ready, and other normal things. Nick and Hannah came over for supper. After supper, we tried some test-runs of Tabletop Simulator, for tomorrow's DnD, with limited success (but enough that we were pretty sure it would work tomorrow). After the kids were put in bed, we thought we might watch an MCU movie, but we ended up watching a bunch of clips of comedians online (Brian Regan, Tim Hawkins, and Jim Gaffigan), and then playing boardgames (Sarah won Sushi Go! twice, then Nick won Dixit). Sarah also worked on Curdie's dog house today.

*** 18 Fri

Sarah finished (more or less) Curdie's dog house. Elle and Suha came over for lunch, and the kids played some Snacktime for them. In the evening, we all (me, Sarah, Nick, Hannah, Oscar, Sam) tried to play DnD for the first time, and met with a ton of technical issues. The session was scheduled to start at 17:00, and Nick and I started tests at about 16:15, but we didn't actually start playing until 19:30, and even then, it was on Sarah's laptop (the least capable of the three computers that can run TTS), in McDonald's, without a working microphone. Still, it was a decent first session.

*** 19 Sat

Sarah was scheduled to work today, but she woke up at ~04:00 with painful nausea and stomach cramps, caused (she's pretty sure) by the McDonald's food from last night. It prevented her from going to work, as she did not feel capable of safely making the drive. I let her sleep it off, and she got out of bed around 10:00, finally feeling better. It was the first snow of the season today, and the power went out at around 14:00.

*** 20 Sun

Sarah worked. I got the kids to church. Suha sat with us and helped out; kids were remarkably good. Gwen cuddled the whole time and didn't raise her voice or fuss once; Cyprian mainly interacted with Vati, but he was better than usual. After church I went to Vati and Mutti's, chatted with Mutti. Nothing major going on. Vati and Mutti leaving later in the week to see Pearl in The Great Comet. I set up my old laptop at their house to upload my music collection to Google Play. Drove home. Gwen napped, Cyprian played on the tablet, I vegged. We had soup for supper (which Sarah had very helpfully put in the crockpot the night before). After Sarah got home (early, for her), we watched one episode of Agents of Shield and then went to bed early.

*** 21 Mon

Sarah worked. I was mentally very tired today. Took the kids to the Niles library and Taco Bell. Monica started the Let's Talk About It group on Facebook for civil political debates, made me moderator (along with Theo Kavouras and Robin Gee). Largely uneventful evening.

*** 22 Tue

In the evening, we went to Fire and Ice for the annual Edward Jones customer appreciation event. Lots of fun. The kids had a great time. Cyprian mainly wanted to play in the soccer area. He threw balls at girls and got in the way of the bigger boys, and had a blast. Gwen mainly wanted to stay in the play house and make play food and scowl at other kids.

*** 23 Wed

I worked downstairs most of the day, studying for my American Government CLEP (as well as playing Dishonored). Mom and Dad came over for lunch. Sarah got kind of frustrated with the kids throughout the day. In the evening, we went to a Divine Service at Emmaus. Before bed, Sarah made an apple pie for Thanksgiving tomorrow at the Nivenses.

*** 24 Thu

We went to the Nivens' for Thanksgiving. Total attendance: me, Sarah, Cyprian, Gwen; Dad, Mom, Matt; Grandma and Grandpa Harrison; Susan, Rick, Michael, David. We had a good time, but it's pretty stressful keeping the kids in line when we're having a meal in a carpeted room with no real tables and a tiny, easily-frightened dog underfoot. I chatted with David a bit about Sabaton and internet humor, etc. Sarah and Matt and I played Sushi Go, and then David joined us for a game of Dixit. We had gone for lunch, but stayed so long we had supper, too. When we came home, we only had energy to watch a little Agents of Shield before going to bed.

*** 25 Fri

Got up super late. After breakfast, I had the kids clean the toys in the living room so they could watch Up, so that I could get some of the many dishes done. Lunch at the Harrisons', and Oly was over to spend the day with Matthew. Cyprian showed off for Oly while Gwen refused to speak to her. After lunch, we all watched The Finest Hours downstairs. Then I took the kids back home and had a mentally tiring evening taking care of them, bathing them, etc. When Sarah got home, we watched the last episode of season 3 of Agents of Shield.

*** 26 Sat

I worked downstairs. Sarah vacuumed and mopped. Kids played with the tablet. Lunch at the H family's, hanging out with Matt. Individual confession and absolution. Then Matt came over in the evening to hang out a bit more (we were going to watch some Shield, but didn't get around to it).

*** 27 Sun

Church, then Vati and Mutti's. Sarah and I left the kids with Vati and Mutti for a bit and went to Walgreens, Goodwill, and Aldi. Then we all went back home. I drove while everyone else slept. At supper, Gwen completely refused to eat any of the main dish. Sarah many times gave her bites which Gwen would then hold in her mouth, without swallowing, for several minutes, until she spat them out all over herself. Sarah declared that Gwen would have the same main dish (Spanish rice) for breakfast the following morning. I went on a run after supper. After the kids were put to bed, Sarah and I worked on Christmas lists.

*** 28 Mon

Sarah worked. I stayed home with the kids. They did alright. Gwen ate nothing today; she had to eat two bites of Spanish Rice before she got any other food, and she completely refused.

*** 29 Tue

I worked downstairs today, Sarah did stuff with the kids. We had Mom and Elle and Suha over for supper. Gwen refused breakfast, but her will broke at lunchtime; she ate her two bites of Spanish Rice, and then had lunch. The total time of her hunger strike was approximately 48 hours.

*** 30 Wed

Worked downstairs (mostly on Anki) while Sarah took care of the kids. In the afternoon/evening, we went to South Bend. First we went through downtown South Bend, where Sarah picked up four tickets for an advance screening of Rogue One (for us, Elle, and Suha). This was a perk for Memorial employees. Then we went by IUSB so Sarah could give one of her old co-workers a little girl's winter coat that we no longer needed. Then we went to Vati and Mutti's and had supper, then we went to church (evening Divine Service). Then we came home. Before going to bed, Sarah and I each worked on our computers, I doing miscellaneous stuff, she buying Christmas gifts.

** 12 Dec
*** 02 Fri

Sarah worked. Suha took the kids in the morning. I worked on the computer. I also went on a run, with the intention of finding my max heartrate. Assuming my Mi Band Pulse has any accuracy to it, my max HR is about 171.

*** 03 Sat

Sarah worked. Bob Johnston's funeral. Suha watched the kids while I went down alone. I sat with Dad and Anna and Alena. Good funeral. Good sermon. The last hymn was Abide With Me. Herta was crying as she walked past our pew. After the service was a 5-minute military "service" in the back of the sanctuary (really just a little ceremony). Then a luncheon downstairs. I spoke with Pr. Grobien a bit, but otherwise I didn't feel very talkative. I gave Sarah's box of Leora-presents to Leora, who spent a good 20 minutes or so going through and commenting on them, and taking about about 1/3 of them. I gave Dad a ride back home, as Anna was going on with Alena. I invited him and Suha over for supper, although only he ended up coming. The evening was alright. I felt very impatient and jittery, so ended up mostly letting the kids play with the tablet. Sarah got home very late, ten or so.

*** 04 Sun

Just after midnight, Sarah got a call from work. A coworker couldn't find some expensive medication that Sarah handled last. It gave Sarah a panic attack, worrying that she'd screwed up, that she was going to be punished or accused of theft, and more immediately, that she wouldn't be able to sleep. I did what I could to calm her down. In the morning, she went to work very tired. I got up with her as Cyprian had had an accident and needed some attention. At work, it was discovered that the med was just in the wrong slot, and it probably wasn't Sarah's fault, and even if it was, it wasn't a big deal. The kids were pretty good at church. There was a relatively uneventful voter's meeting after the service. Then I took the kids to Vati and Mutti's (even though Vati and Mutti couldn't join us), where we relaxed and had lunch. Then we drove home (via Walgreens), slowly due to the snow starting to pick up (first time this season). Not too long after we got home, the H family came over with supper (they had initially invited us to their house, but Dad just spent a while repainting the kitchen so it wasn't ready to actually be used). Sarah got home late, and we finished watching Iron Man 2 (we had watched the first half a few evenings ago).

*** 05 Mon

Sarah got a call earlyish in the morning from her boss, warning her and apologizing for a nasty email that the HR lady at Memorial had apparently sent Sarah regarding the med issue from yesterday. Sarah took the kids for the whole day, and I worked downstairs (learning a bit of javascript for Google Sheets, and a bit of ... whatever AutoHotKey uses for AutoHotkey, and doing some minor tasks with Anki and music, and working towards my American Government and American History CLEPs). Dad came over for lunch and he and Elle both came for supper.

*** 06 Tue

Sarah spent the whole morning and afternoon making food and getting ready for the party in the evening. I spent the same time scanning hymns and putting together the hymn booklet, at Sarah's request, for the party (and mostly for Grandpa H). Grandma and Grandpa H, Mom and Dad, Vati and Mutti, and Elle and Suha came to the party (joint birthday party for me and Grandpa). Vati brought an electric keyboard and he played while we all sang hymns (Grandpa also sang a few extra songs). Then we had supper. Vati and Mutti also gave Sarah and me a present: an "Instant Pot" (combination crockpot, pressure cooker, other stuff). I also managed to get Cyprian to sing "Snuggle Puppy" near the end of the party. We heard later that Grandpa had a really good time, so it was definitely a success.

*** 07 Wed

I worked downstairs today while Sarah had the kids. In the evening, we went to church, partially because I needed to be there for adult choir practice. Sarah wanted to head home as soon as possible, to get the kids started on their bedtime routine, so Elle drove me home. She and I talked about Harry Potter (Elle just recently finished the series) while she drove.

*** 08 Thu

Sarah worked. I stayed at home with the kids. Did a full school session with the kids for the first time in a while. Ran behind and didn't get the kids in bed until after 21:00.

*** 09 Fri

Sarah worked. I stayed at home with the kids. I tried to make bread for the Talisman game tomorrow but none of it rose.

*** 10 Sat

In the morning, we all went to the Osbuns'. I started a very long game of Talisman (using every expansion) with Josh, Nick, Ian, and Matthew Horner. Sarah stayed with the kids until around 13:00, chatting with Sarah Osbun and letting the kids play, and then she and the kids went to Vati and Mutti's. Meanwhile, the Talisman game lasted from 10:15 to 18:20. When it was finally over, Matthew gave me a ride to Vati and Mutti's, where I then caught up with Sarah and Mutti and the kids, who were doing the candlelight walk. I joined them for a quick horse-drawn cart ride back to the beginning of the street. We went back to Vati and Mutti's for hot chocolate. At this point, Mutti offered to take the kids for the night so Sarah and I could go out to eat or watch a movie (our original plan for the day, when we thought Talisman would take more like 5-6 hours). We might have accepted, except Cyprian's asthma was flaring up. So we went home, gave him a breathing treatment, and then all went to bed.

*** 11 Sun

Church in the morning. Kids were alright. After the service, I chatted with Nick and Hannah and Josh about Talisman for a bit. After Bible Class, we went to Vati and Mutti's for lunch. Mutti talked with Sarah about the Seyboldts, about the kids frequently not eating. The possibility of calling CPS was raised (Sarah may have to, as a mandated reporter). Then we came home (via Aldi for groceries, and a gas station for air in the tires). We unloaded and relaxed for a bit (I took a nap). Then we went to Mom and Dad's for supper. I talked briefly with Mom and Martin and Suha (Mrs. Horner recently asked Mom who Martin should talk to if he wanted to date Suha. Mom talked to Suha about it, who was not entirely decisive in her answers, except that she did not want Aunt Kim called. Unfortunately, we don't actually know whether Mrs. Horner's question was made on behalf of Martin or not).

*** 12 Mon

Sarah worked (she was put on-call at first, but then called in at about 09:00). I did school with the kids and otherwise watched them.

*** 13 Tue

Sarah worked. I did school with the kids and otherwise watched them. Dad came over for a few hours to make bird feeders with them.

*** 14 Wed

Sarah worked, but was sent home early (about 16:00). I had the kids. At 13:00, Grandpa H called and asked if he could come over in an hour to put together some train sets with the kids. I said yes, and he showed up at 15:00. He stayed for about an hour and a half, and occupied the kids during that time (I got stuff done around the house). I think they all had a good time. Grandpa left the train sets, but Sarah and I decided to put them away and only get them out when he was around. After Grandpa left, I started getting the kids ready to go to church, when Grandpa appeared again and said he was stuck in the snow. I looked and his car was right across the road from the house. I gave the kids the tablet and went out, first to try to drive his car out (I couldn't), then to try to pull it out with our Expedition. But when I went out the second time, Dad appeared, and offered to get Grandpa out using the skid-steer. So he did that while I loaded up the kids and we drove to church. Cyprian is in his new booster seat, which he calls his "rocket seat". We got to church, and Sarah arrived (from work) a few minutes later. After the service, Sarah took the kids back home in the Expedition and left the Subaru for me, and I stayed for choir practice (1 hour). Afterwards I come home, via Walmart (for long underwear and a few miscellaneous items).

*** 15 Thu

I went on a run before lunch, for the first time in a while. In the evening, Elle came over and the three of us went to see Rogue One at Showplace 16 (meeting Suha there). Madeline Renneberg watched the kids.

*** 16 Fri

Nothing scheduled  today. Took it easy. Sarah watched the kids, cleaned, etc. I worked downstairs. In the evening, after supper, I put the kids to bed while Sarah went to Mom and Dad's for a Harry Potter movie mini marathon with Elle and Anna and Suha. They got through movies 1 and 2. They also chatted with Suha about her love life (Suha is hanging out with Martin, but they're not dating. ?I imagine she's annoyed that it's a topic of discussion.).

*** 17 Sat

Sarah watched the kids while I worked downstairs. They were pretty ornery and she was getting tired, so after lunch, I watched them for an hour or so while Sarah napped. Then Sarah took them sledding at Mom and Dad's (Elle joined in) while I got ready for a run. When I got outside, however, it was too slippery to run, so I went back in and tried a strength fitness routine (the "Bodyweight Exercise" app, based on the subreddit). In the evening, after the kids were in bed, Luke came by for about an hour to talk (he'd just got back from Augustine. His hair was in a kind of funky style.). Anna also showed up for a bit. Before going to bed, Sarah put in her requests for the next Memorial scheduling period.

*** 18 Sun

Oscar was at church today (visiting Nick and Hannah, primarily), and he and I and Nick talked about Star Wars. Nick also mentioned that our selected day for the next D&D round would not work, due to Oscar's surgery; haven't rescheduled yet. After church, Sarah and I took the kids to the McGraths' to hang out with Elizabeth and Ella. Ella and Zip and Gwen got along quite well. Then we drove home via Aldi (a few groceries) and Goodwill (this and that). Got home in time to go over to the family's for supper and a game of Dixit. In the shower before bed, I noticed an alarmingly large welt on my upper right back. It was a tiny bit itchy. It was gone by evening of the following day. Also: Josh Osbun mentioned to me the possibility of a job as a dispatcher for a Wakarusa ambulance service.

*** 19 Mon

Sarah worked. It was very cold today - negatives (F) for much of the day. In the morning, after breakfast, the H family took the kids Christmas tree hunting while I went on a long (and actually not too cold) run. I had lunch over at the family's, and then Anna took the kids for another few hours while I did stuff at home.

*** 20 Tue

Sarah worked while I stayed at home with the kids. We didn't go out all day - I was kind of tired, the kids were kind of tired, Cyprian seemed vaguely sick, etc. I did get a pretty decent amount of stuff done at home, though. We got a call from Quentin and the Karis Group (?), basically checking in on what we'd done (or hadn't done) to negotiate the $11k bill from Sarah's surgery. He seemed pleased with what Sarah had accomplished, and told us our shares would start coming in soon. I was added as a beta tester of Smash Up on Android, so I downloaded that and played a few games. Sarah had a pretty tough day at work, got home late, but was better when she got back than she had been midway through the day. I worked out again (good times).

*** 21 Wed

Sarah was called off work. She made some phonecalls and left some messages regarding recent medical bills. We had the family over for lunch. Went to a divine service in the evening. Afterwards, she took the kids home while I stayed for choir practice, and then went home with Elle and Anna (we talked about music, and smartphones, and stuff).

*** 22 Thu

Sleepy morning. Did some work downstairs. The whole family napped after lunch. Sarah and I took the kids sledding (Elle and Anna and Luke joined us) for about an hour before supper. Supper included Rick and Susan, Michael, and Kris. Lots of talking about historical/political stuff at the table. After the meal was done, everyone gathered to talk about what to do about Grandma and Grandpa H (who are getting to be dangerous drivers, and generally a little demented). I left at 21:00 to put the kids to bed, and Sarah came an hour or so later. We stayed up a bit doing computer work. Note: Walter Sanders died today.

*** 23 Fri

Sarah worked at PACE today - her first PRN shift there. It went well. I stayed at home with the kids, cleaned etc. Ordered Sarah's new phone (Honor 5X), case, and MicroSD. Hope it works. Sarah got groceries on the way back. Mutti called and talked about Walter Sanders. Apparently it was she and Vati who found him. After Sarah got back, we went over to the family's for supper. Daniel was there. After eating, we talked for a while, and played some Sushi Go!. Then we went home and put the kids to bed. Sarah was exhausted and also went to bed, but I stayed up and Daniel, Elle, Anna, and Luke came over and we all played Coup. After they left, I felt contemplative and stayed up too late doing computer work.

*** 24 Sat

We all had lunch at Mom and Dad's, then, after talking for a while, went downstairs and watched WALL-E. Daniel had never seen it before, and it was a good way to occupy the kids. Sarah went back home to make food and wrap presents. After the movie, we gave the kids a quick bath, I discovered and patched (with duct tape) a broken piece on the back of the Expedition (part of the back glass), then we went down to Emmaus for the first Christmas Eve service. After the service we went to Vati and Mutti's and had supper and put the kids to bed, then went back for the midnight service (Sarah stayed behind with the kids).

*** 25 Sun

Christmas Day. Sarah worked. I took the kids to church, then to Vati and Mutti's, then to Mom and Dad's. I was going to drop them off and then go home just long enough to take care of Curdie, but the family offered to watch the kids for a while, so I went home and napped and unwound. Then I went back and I and the kids had supper with the family.

*** 26 Mon

Sarah worked. I don't remember exactly what I did, but I know that somehow the kids once again ended up at Mom and Dad's long enough for me to take a nap. We all had supper there again, and Sarah was even able to join us (a bit late), after being sent home early from work. There was a debate at the supper table that started with Daniel asking the difference between Russian Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, and some other brand of Orthodoxy. After Sarah and I got home and put the kids to bed, Sarah immediately fell asleep on our bed. I stayed up a bit, doing dishes and writing up my feedback on the Smash Up beta for Android.

*** 27 Tue

Christmas celebration at the Harrisons'. Sarah got up early to make food. We went over for breakfast, then opened presents, then Grandma and Grandpa Harrison arrived, then Aunt Sue and Uncle Rick and Michael, and we had lunch and took pictures and generally hung out. I got into a heated but friendly debate with Anna, Mom, Dad, and Rick about politics (libertarianism etc). In the evening, I, Sarah, Elle, Daniel, Matt, and Luke went to church; Dad was staying behind to talk with Rick about geneology stuff, and Mom stayed behind to be with Dad and watch the kids, and Anna stayed behind because she wasn't feeling the best (she ended up watching A New Hope with Michael). On the way back from church, we stopped by Menards so Luke could pick up some stuff. We also played the car game "Connect".

*** 28 Wed

Christmas celebration at the elder Rheins'. Went over at 10:00. Opened presents, had a big lunch, opened more presents, snacked constantly. The kids ate millions of pretzel sticks. Sarah became very tired and slept for about two hours. Margaret and Naomi and I talked about the Gilmore Girls Netflix specials. We all went to church in the evening, during which Gwen fell asleep. Then we went back to Vati and Mutti's for a late lunch and to open the last few presents. We got back home around 22:30. Noticed another one of those weird temporary lumps on my back (slightly right of center, lower back).

*** 29 Thu

Sarah worked. It was Daniel's last day in town, and Margaret's, and I thought about visiting one of them, but I and the kids were all pretty tired (Cyprian spent several hours mostly lying on the couch), so we just stayed home and I tried to more or less clean the house. We went to Mom and Dad's for supper, and it was nice, but everyone else seemed kind of tired, too.

*** 30 Fri

We (I, Sarah, the kids, Vati and Mutti, Naomi and her kids, Mom and Dad, and Grandpa Harrison) went caroling at PACE in the morning, then we all went to Fire and Ice for lunch. I was feeling pretty tired but overall it was a very nice time. After we got home, we cleaned up the house, and then had the book discussion group (Elle and Matt and Anna, Brian, Jill, and Chris) over for supper and to watch a movie ("There Be Dragons").

*** 31 Sat

Sarah had agreed to work an extra shift today, but they got an agency nurse or something, so they didn't call her in. After breakfast, she took the kids and went with Dad on a walk through the woods. Then we all had lunch at Mom and Dad's, and played a game of Munchkin. Then I went home and tried to nap. Then we went to church for the New Year's Eve service. Cyprian was very bad and got taken out of the church about seven times (and also started the service by peeing all over the bathroom floor). Sarah and I talked about parenting on the way back home. We went to Mom and Dad's and had supper (Oly was there as well), then put the kids down to sleep on Mom and Dad's bed, and played some Bananagrams and Balderdash. At around 23:00, Sarah went home to sleep. I went with her, and we took the kids home and put them in their own beds. Then I went back and played some more games with the family: some BS, and then Coup. Shortly after midnight, we tried a few games of Meteor. We all talked with (and lightly teased) Matt and Oly. I went back home around 01:15.

* 2017
** 01 Jan
*** 01 Sun

Sarah worked. I took the kids to church. Mom and Dad sat with me to help watch them. They did pretty well. After church, there was no Bible Class - everyone had a few snacks and Vati took some pictures for the church directory, then we left. Lunch at Vati and Mutti's; hanging out and chatting with Naomi. Cyprian played mostly with Sita.

*** 02 Mon

In the morning, Dad and Matt and Luke came over and we cut down the dead/dying tree in our front yard (Matt and Luke stopped traffic on opposite sides of the road, and I held the ladder and did miscellaneous things while did did the actual work of chainsawing the tree and pushing it off the road with the skid-steer). After lunch (at Mom and Dad's), we all (us and all the Harrisons) went downstairs and watched Sully. Cyprian cuddled throughout the whole movie. About 20 minutes from the end, Zack Candy and Davis Brown arrived. When the movie was done, we went home to get ready to go to church and run some evening errands. It became apparent that Cyprian was not feeling well (aside from being tired and cuddly, he asked me to carry him home, told me his "whole body" felt sick, and when I asked what he wanted to do, responded "be asleep"). I was going to stay home with him and Gwen, but Elle offered to watch them (and she seemed interested in having some time to get things done), so she watched both kids while the rest of us went to church (Sarah and I stopped briefly at Memorial for Sarah to drop off some paperwork). It was a brief spoken divine service, and the power went out just before the homily. Pastor paused for just a moment and then resumed. A number of people pulled out flashlights or smartphones, Dad and Vati went downstairs to check things out, and a little later Vati and Matt passed out some of those little fake electric candles. Communion hymns were basically chosen by people either just starting to sing them, or announcing a number (Mutti provided all starting notes). After the service, Dad did some more investigating and pronounced the cause to be a blown main fuse, and he made the call or did whatever needed to be done (apparently the power went back on just as he was leaving). Sarah and I took Zack and went home via Aldi (groceries) and Taco Bell (supper). In the late evening, everyone (except Davis) came over to have some desert and chat. Eventually Mom and Dad came over and the rest of us played Dixit...

*** 03 Tue

A day at home. Zack came by and stayed for a few hours. Sarah and I played a bunch of games of Meteor before going to bed. Sarah's new phone (Honor 5X) arrived.

*** 04 Wed

Another day at home. I wore myself out by running, working out, and going through my mobility and stretching routines. Zack came over again, after breakfast. We and the kids watched Song of the Sea with him, chatted, had supper, and played some Meteor. Then he left. Sarah and I played a bit of Meteor before bed. In bed, we talked about Zack, about how he was doing.

*** 05 Thu

Sarah worked. I watched the kids, and worked on Sarah's phone (updating it, etc.). It was very cold and snowy outside.

*** 06 Fri

Same as yesterday: Sarah worked. I watched the kids, and worked on Sarah's phone (updating it, etc.). It was very cold and snowy outside.

*** 08 Sun

Church, chatting with guys about Stranger Things etc., Bible Class (Pastor made a completely random comment about goats that Sarah might want to buy), then Vati and Mutti's house for lunch. Mutti gave Cyprian his first piano lesson. Then we came home and napped. Don't remember anything else.

*** 09 Mon

Suha had supper with us. She seemed quiet, although she made a point of staying until, and participating in, our devotions with the kids.

*** 10 Tue

Work at home day for Sarah and me. Mutti came by in the morning to pick up the cheap laptop she got to give to someone in Ethiopia, to give us their old microwave (ours died a few days ago), and to give Cyprian his second piano lesson. Gwen refused her rice at lunch, and it followed her to supper, so she ate nothing after lunch today. Elle had supper with us, and talked about problems at the Harrison house (mostly Mom and Dad issues, but also Suha issues). She said that Suha and Martin Horner are officially dating now? Not entirely clear. She left after supper, but then after the kids were in bed, she came back over with Dad, and we started Rogue One. After about fifteen minutes, Mom called, having just arrived home after a trip to take care of her mom (and some other stuff?), so Dad went back to the house to be with her. Sarah and Elle and I watched Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire instead (Sarah and Elle, and I think to some extent Anna and Suha, are working through all the movies).

*** 11 Wed

Felt kind of groggy for much of the day. Behind on sleep, I think. Mom and Dad came over for lunch, and afterward Dad went on a walk with Sarah and the kids (I napped). I spent several hours troubleshooting my R11, which was giving me headaches (I eventually traced the problem to a partially corrupted SD card, which I reformatted). In the evening, Sarah thoroughly cleaned and reorganized the bathroom, and spent a lot of time goat-shopping and goat-planning. Cyprian disobeyed one too many times at supper, and I told him he was done with supper for the day. He remained tearful and pleading for the rest of the evening. Gwen ate nothing today, still refusing her two bites of white rice. After the kids went to bed, I continued working on my R11, while Sarah continued working on goat stuff. She brought up the idea of approaching Grandpa H for financial help with the goats (more for his sake than ours).

*** 12 Thu

Sarah worked a shortish day at PACE. In the evening, we went over to Mom and Dad's for supper; Grandma and Grandpa H were there, as well. Mom finally, after a solid 10-15 minutes of private conversation, coaxed Gwen into eating her two bites of rice, thus ending her hunger strike after 54 hours (a new record). Gwen then shoveled down a ton of supper. Sarah talked to Grandma and Grandpa about goats and stuff.

*** 13 Fri

Sarah worked. Suha took the kids for the morning.

*** 14 Sat

Sarah worked. I took the kids to the Niles library, then to Taco Bell, then I dropped them off with Mom and Dad, and they all took down Christmas decorations for a while. Sarah came home tired. We watched some Parks and Rec, and then I stayed up doing computer work.

*** 15 Sun

Sarah worked. I got the kids to church. They did pretty decently. After the service I chatted with Egon and Tobias about games. Pastor Seyboldt led Bible Class (Pastor Stuckwisch was elsewhere today), and after Bible Class I talked with Nick about stuff (marriage, work, life) until it was time to go. Vati took me and the kids and Elle to Fazoli's. It was a nice trip, although the kids were very high-energy. Elle and I talked about the recent engagement between Andrew Casey and Alena Grobien (announced on Facebook a few days ago). Apparently the date they're looking at is Feb. 5 (less than three weeks away). After Fazoli's, I drove the kids home, and put Gwen down for a nap, and gave Cyprian the tablet so I could have a few minutes to lie down. Then I took the kids over to Mom an dDad's for supper (it was just Mom and Dad and Elle there; Suha's been spending a lot of evenings with the Horners recently). It was a nice meal, although near the end Gwen suddenly became distressed and vomited red velvet cheesecake everywhere (it was a desert she'd had at Fazoli's). Before leaving, Mom and Dad played with the kids for a good half hour. When I got the kids home, I was about to brush their teeth when Gwen vomited again, in the bathroom, spraying the counter and a bunch of stuff. So I set the kids to playing with toys while I scrubbed it up and bleached everything. By the time I was done, Sarah was home. While she was showering, Gwen vomited again, though not as much. We put the kids to bed, and Gwen had three more vomiting episodes during the night, requiring several changes of clothing and bedsheets, and stuffed animals getting tossed in the washing machine.

*** 16 Mon

After the excitement of last night, we all got up rather late. We restricted Gwen to water, juice, popsicles, and Jell-O today. She threw up once or twice after breakfast, but no more after that. She slept a lot, and seemed fairly perky by nighttime. Sarah and Zip went with Dad to get the family's old goat trailer. I spent some time researching LAN games for Tobias's planned LAN parties. Before bed, Sarah and I watched a bunch of Parks and Rec.

*** 17 Tue

Around now is when all four of us got sick. I don't think anything particularly significant happened from now through the 20th. We all felt sick, though not precisely at the same time. The kids each had some vomiting episodes, while Sarah and I just had nausea (we probably avoiding throwing up by simply not eating).

*** 18 Wed

Sarah worked today.

*** 19 Thu

Sarah worked today.

*** 21 Sat

"Sarah and Anna and the kids took the family's old goat trailer to get a bunch of hay. Then I joined them and we all took a walk. Then, while they finished the walk and went back to Mom and Dad's house to have supper and play games (Davis Brown was also there), I packed up my desktop and drove to Tobias' house for a LAN. Other than Tobias and myself, there were Rita, Egon, Becca, Leora, Nick, and Aaron. After an hour of setting everyone up and installing Battle for Middle-earth II on all the computers, we tried two matches. The first was a 5 or 6 player FFA (this was before everyone was set up). I felt I was doing alright but my computer crashed before I got into any real battles. Then we did teams: me, Nick, Tobias and... I think Becca, vs everyone else. Egon basically won the game. Then Nick had to leave. Then we tried to play Star Wars Battlefront 2, but it kept crashing, so isntead we played Jedi Academy. Then Aaron left. Then we tried to play Age of Empires 2, but it took a long time to set up, so I started up Towerfall: Ascension and we played a bit of that, then everyone but Tobias had to leave. So Tobias and I played a round of Sanctum 2, and then a few levels of Bloody Trapland. I left just after midnight.

It was a good session, despite all the technical issues. I gave Tobias the Tex Beetle mechanical keyboard I'd had lying around (ever since I got it in trade for a QuickFire), and at the end of the night he gave me one of his extra monitors (24"" and 1080p - much better than what I was using). This evening was also the first time I'd ever seen Tobias' house (which, as far as I could tell, consisted of the bottom half of a duplex). It was not in the least surprising: a very clean bathroom, a reasonably clean computer room full of computers and electronics, and then a living room, a kitchen, and a bedroom, all of which looked as though a bomb had gone off in them."

*** 22 Sun

"Just after midnight, I was on my way home from Tobias' house, and I stopped for gas at the station near the Horners'. It was deserted when I pulled up. While I was pumping, a car pulled up on the other side of my pump, and a lady came out and started talking to me. She was clearly drunk, and immediately began telling me a long sob story with lots of confusing details. What I remember: her name was Jessica and she was 42. She'd just come from a party, maybe an office party, and she had another lady from the party in her car. She had two daughters (I think) and was divorced. Her mom had died recently, it was her birthday yesterday, and there were at least two jerks in her extended family causing trouble for everyone. She said several times that she was a good person, and that she worked very hard. She told me several times that she wasn't asking for money, and also asked me several times not to call the cops.

Eventually I got the thrust of her request: she was running on fumes, she had only cash (somewhere between one and two dollars), her phone was dead, and she didn't know how to get back to her home (Goshen). She wanted to give me cash in exchange for using my debit card to put some gas in her car (the gas station itself was closed), and give her directions to Goshen. She brandished her iPhone at me many times to show how it was dead, and at one point shoved it in my pocket as collateral. As I mentioned, she was visibly extremely drunk.

Eventually, I asked her if she was okay to drive, which was really a rhetorical question, and she said she was. I asked how many drinks she'd had, and she said ""a few beers"". I said, what number? She said, ""a few beers"". Later she also copped to a shot, which she had right before leaving, for some good reason. I asked her how much her passenger had had to drink, and she said not very much, and introduced me to her.

Jessica's passenger, who she'd only met today, was a black lady name Alisha (I think). She was giving her a ride home. I asked Alisha how many drinks she'd had, and she said ""one"". She looked entirely sober to me. So I told them that I'd put some gas in the car if they agreed that Alisha would drive. They both readily agreed, Alisha adding that she had been terrified when Jessica was the one driving. Alisha went further, and offered that Jessica could spend the night at her house, which I then made an additional requirement for the gas, and which was also readily accepted. When I then told Jessica that I was going to put $10 worth of gas in the car, and didn't want her cash, she became very teary (she had been medium teary up until now) and started insisting that she pay me back somehow. She asked for my phone number (which I didn't give her), I assumed with the intention of later sending me money, but immediately afterwards she saw my ring, and said ""Oh, you're married."" in a sort of disappointed way, so maybe she was offering me a date? Slightly flattering, I guess, though I'd already told her I was 27 (after she guessed 32). I told her to pay it forward, but she said she already always did. Eventually I told her that I hoped she had a good night, and that I'd pray for her. When I said that, she suddenly said ""My name's not Jessica, it's Jackie."" I suppose she gave me a fake name in self-defense, but what I'm not sure about is this: when I told her I'd pray for her, did she give me her real name because that's when she trusted me, or because she wanted to make sure I was praying for the right person?

She told me that she had approached me because I looked ""so normal"", and shortly before I managed to get away, she became very emotional and sort of asked/lamented about how people ""like"" me were so put together (a little ironic, given I was driving our rusty old Subaru), while people like her dealt with... all the stuff she dealt with. I told her that there were blessings but there was also luck, and that everyone had challenges, and that having more challenges didn't mean you were a worse person. She was a little flirty at the end, giving me several hugs (and doing that thing at the end of the hug where your hand trails down and touches the other person's hand), so I insisted several times that I had to get back to my wife, and finally (after a total of 20-30 minutes) I managed to escape.

The drive home was extremely slow, on account of some of the thickest fog I'd ever seen. On some parts of the highway I could see no more than two of the dotted lines in front of the car. So I put on my brights and flashers and just drove very slowly. I got home around 01:30, and then spent an hour or so unloading the car, and setting up my desktop in my office again, complete with the new monitor from Tobias.

Then it was morning, and time for church. We also brought the snacks for Bible Class, and had to bring print-outs and Mutti's projector (borrowed) for Sarah's presentation. Church went pretty well. I chatted with Nick, Hannah, Sander, and Caleb about philosophy (Theseus' boat and similar), then later with Nick, Sander, and Egon about Star Wars and prequels. After Bible Class, I helped set up the projector, and then watched the kids while Sarah gave her presentation to the youth on health and hygeine (after the main presentation, they broke into groups, with Mr. Jindra giving the males a talk about communication, while Sarah gave the females a talk about feminine-specific issues). Then we went to Aldi and home. Sarah and I was exhausted, and napped (sort of) until about 18:15, and then went to Mom and Dad's for supper. After supper, we played Meteor with Mom, Dad, and Elle."

*** 23 Mon

Sarah worked.

*** 24 Tue

Sarah worked.

*** 26 Thu

We had Grandma and Grandpa H, and Suha, over for lunch. Around 13:00, we got a delivery of 20 tons of gravel for the goat barn. The delivery guy dumped it at the bottom of the hill, close to the barn, but due to the mud (it snowed this morning), he got stuck trying to leave again. I trying giving him a little help by pulling him, first with the Expedition, then with Dad's skid-steer, but neither could do it. So Sarah and I called (and payed $200 for) a towing company, Precision Towing out of Niles. They came with a big truck and pulled the guy out. Sarah felt bad for the extra expense, but I think she acted reasonably and couldn't have known it would happen. I spent a few hours moving gravel into the barn (scooping it a bit closer with the skid-steer, and shoveling it actually into the barn with a regular spade). Sarah and the kids came out and helped me for the second half.

*** 27 Fri

Sarah worked at PACE while I stayed home with the kids. Suha came by briefly to pick up her check for babysitting. Sometime after lunch, Grandpa called and said he had some outdoor lights for Sarah. He brought them over, and then stayed for about an hour and a half, chatting, singing songs, and interacting with the kids. Sarah got home at ~17:00. I did a bit of work downstairs (finally got my old laptop recognizing HDDs again, by flipping a switch in BIOS). We played a few family games of Spelunky before putting the kids to bed, and then watched one episode of Parks and Rec before going to bed ourselves.

*** 28 Sat

In the morning, Sarah and I and the kids shoveled gravel into the barn. Then after lunch, Sarah took the kids while I worked downstairs. We went to Confession and Absolution in the afternoon (saw Mutti for the first time since she got back from her recent overseas trip), picked up Ariksander, and went home, meeting Anna, Ian, and Erik and Matthew Horner for supper and board games. The others played one or two games of Exploding Kittens while Sarah and I put the kids to bed, and then me and Sander and Anna played two games of Revolution while the others played Small World. Then we all talked about movies (mostly) for an hour or so. We lent Erik and Matthew the Harrisons' copy of "Beyond the Mask", after talking it up (down) a lot. At ~23:00, everyone left except Anna, who stayed to talk about life (looking at Eastern Orthodoxy, looking at Davis Brown, anxiety over the quickly approaching Andrew/Alena wedding).

*** 29 Sun

Church in the morning. During church, Anna called me, asking for help, having locked herself out of everything. Eventually, she managed to get the Reneberg's spare key for our house, and then go to my office and get my spare key to the Harrisons' house, and then get in there and get into her car. After church, I chatted with Nick and Caleb. Sarah helped out Lizzie when Vincent had a major accident. After church, we went to Vati and Mutti's for lunch. Then we came home. Anna joined us for supper, and watched a few episodes of Parks and Rec with us.

*** 30 Mon

Sarah worked at PACE today. In the evening, Luke called Sarah to tell her he had a girlfriend (Anneke, from Augustine. She's 21, he's 16).

*** 31 Tue

Sarah worked. I had a low-ebb day.

** 02 Feb
*** 01 Wed

Sarah worked. I had a very low-ebb day.

*** 02 Thu

Sarah interviewed for a private duty home health care nurse gig. I applied for a few jobs online. We had supper at the family's, with Mom and Elle and Suha and Martin. After supper, Sarah talked with Mom (about goats, I think), while I played Pictionary with the others (Martin and I were on a team. The girls won narrowly).

*** 03 Fri

Suha came over for lunch, after she and Sarah and the kids went on a walk. I went to Berrien Springs to hand in my application for IT Ambassador, then I went to the library to write for an hour. Then I went to the post office to get stamps, though I got there just after they closed. Then Hardings to get a few things. While I was at Hardings, Sarah called and asked on behalf of Suha to pick up some ingredients that Suha needed to make supper for everyone. Suha texted me a link to a recipe, whose ingredients included several other recipes, so I spent something like an hour running around trying to find everything. When I got back, I gave the food to Suha, and after a little bit, I and Sarah and the kids went to the family's for supper. Martin was over and had helped Suha. Gwen was not feeling well and had a fever, so we went home shortly after supper.

*** 04 Sat

Sarah worked. Both kids were sick - Gwen with a low fever, Cyprian with a high fever and generally sick affect (restless, uncomfortable, sinus stuff, etc.). So basically it was a gatorade and ice cream, movies and tablet kind of day. Sarah got home late.

*** 05 Sun

Sarah worked. The kids were still sick, so I stayed home with them. Very uneventful day; lots of movie and tablet time for the kids, lots of misc computer stuff for me. I made a final attempt at fixing my Galaxy S3, and managed to hard brick it, so I was without a phone for the latter half of the day. Before this happened Elle texted me that she was going by a grocery, and I asked her to pick up a few things for us. I stayed up late using Sarah's phone's hotspot to decide on and order a new phone (Honor 5X for $95 on eBay).

*** 06 Mon

Sarah worked. The kids seemed pretty much recovered, but it was still an at-home day. I cleaned the house. Sarah told me that while she was at work, Susan Nivens called her, worried about Grandma Harrison's health. Sarah got in contact with Dad, and he went to see Grandma. Dad stopped by the house around 20:00, for a brief update and to ask whether he might borrow Cyprian's nebulizer later, for Grandma to use (although he did not end up doing so). Sarah and I watched some Parks and Rec before going to bed.

*** 07 Tue

Sarah spent most of the day working in the barn, shoveling gravel etc. Dad helped with the skidsteer, but for less than an hour, as it started to malfunction. I and the kids also helped, but also for no more than an hour, as they got tired and had to be taken in and put down for naps.

*** 08 Wed

Sarah was scheduled to work today, but she accepted on-call status (no call ever came). I started to feel a little sick today. My new phone (Huawei Honor 5X) arrived and I spent several hours after lunch unlocking the bootloader, rooting it, etc. At ~14:30 I went to Eau Claire. I picked up some copies of our updated car insurance cards, deposited our first four Samaritan checks for Sarah's ER visit, got a few groceries at Dollar General, and spent the rest of the time at the library, where I split my time between writing and setting up the phone. I got home and we had supper, then Mom and Dad and Elle joined us and had supper also. After we put the kids to bed, Sarah worked in the barn for about an hour, then she and I watched some Parks and Rec before getting to bed late.

*** 09 Thu

I spent the day watching the kids while Sarah spent the day getting ready for her trip tomorrow to go pick up goats. We had supper with the family in the evening, and Martin as well. We played Meteor. I stayed up late (in the cold) working on the car: I had to connect the trailer lights that Sarah got to the Expedition, but the old plug on the Expedition was the wrong size, so I cut it off and put on a new one. I disconnected the battery before doing this. When I reconnected the battery, the car would not turn on. I suspected anti-theft measures, and spent several hours trying to work it out. Eventually we decided that the battery was actually dead. We decided that I would go get a new battery from AutoZone in the morning.

*** 10 Fri

I went to AutoZone and got a new battery for the Expedition. Came back, put it in, and it worked (although I had not wired the trailer light plug quite right, and had to spend a few minutes fixing it). Dad and I hitched the trailer to the Expedition and got everything wired and set up, then drove to the nearby gas station / car place to get all the tires pumped up (we also took a spare tire for the trailer, which Jim at the gas station generously gave us). Then Sarah and Elle drove off to get goats. I let the kids watch a movie, and then Mom and Dad took them for most of the rest of the day, while I slept. In the evening, after the kids were in bed, I watched some Black Mirror, and then called Margaret and talked with her for a while.

*** 11 Sat

Uneventful morning. I and the kids had lunch with the family (Mom and Dad and Suha), and then I left the kids with them while I went back home. Mostly cleaned (got rid of all the cardboard boxes downstairs). Went back over to the family's for supper - Annalise was there, too. After I put the kids to bed, I cleaned a bit more, until Sarah and Elle got back with the goats. One big doe (possibly pregnant) named "Mindy", and two Nigerian Dwarfs (a buck named "Treacle" and a doe named "Crme Brle"). Mom and Dad and Anna and Suha all came over to faun over them and help out. We got them settled in the barn (Treacle immediately squeezed through the bars of his pen, so we reinforced them with plastic fencing, and put Crme in a doggie crate so that he couldn't bother her), and everyone else went home. Sarah and I unpacked the car, got things ready for church tomorrow, and went to bed.

*** 12 Sun

After church, there was a family day at Emmaus, but Sarah and I elected not to stay for it. We dropped the kids off with Vati (Mutti is out of the country) and went to Aldi for groceries. Then we went back to Vati and Mutti's, had sandwiches, and hung out while the kids watched some cartoons. Then we went home and we all napped. We had supper at Mom and Dad's. Anna was still around, and Grandma and Grandpa Harrison also came over, for Elle's birthday.

*** 13 Mon

Sarah worked her first shift (and orientation) at her new home health care job (caring for the child with Downs Syndrome).

*** 14 Tue

Sarah took the kids while I went to the bank, and then to the Library to work for a few hours (mostly writing). Then Elle watched the kids while Sarah and I went out on a date to the Wood Fire, followed by a walk.

*** 15 Wed

Sarah worked. I had an uneventful day with the kids. Sarah got a ticket (but no fine) on her way home because one or two headlights are out on the Subaru. Been out for a while; my fault for not fixing them. Sarah and I watched some Parks and Rec before bed.

*** 16 Thu

Daniel came over for supper (Elle was temporarily away), and ended up helping me replace the headlight in the Subaru, as well as check the oil, brake, and transmission fluid levels. I went to Berrien Springs. First to AutoZone (to drop off the Expedition's old battery for testing, and to pick up a replacement brake light for the Subaru), then the bank (to deposit checks), then the library (to work), then Hardings (Sarah needed some ingredients for the dessert she was making for tonight). I was a little late leaving the library because I discovered I had dropped my key to the Expedition somewhere (eventually I checked with the front desk, and someone had found it in the parking lot and turned it in). We had supper at Mom and Dad's, with Suha and Martin and Elle and Daniel. We stayed for a while afterwards and played Pictionary.

*** 17 Fri

Sarah worked. I stayed at home with the kids. It was a nice day, so we wandered around outside for a bit. Dad came over briefly at night to warn us that he was burning some prairie land.

*** 18 Sat

We all had breakfast at the family's (with Mom, Elle, and Daniel), and then Mom and Sarah and the kids went on a several-hour trip to go look at prospective goats. I chatted with Elle and Daniel for a few minutes before going home. I worked a bit, played some games, went on a run, and then got ready to go to Tobias' house for a LAN. Left shortly after Sarah and the kids arrived. Got to Tobias' house at 17:00. Total in attendance at the LAN: me, Tobias, Rita, Egon, Becca, Leora, Erik, Matthew, Aaron. We played Battlefield 2, which was pretty fun although we only had 5 people playing at a time which is a very small number for that game. Then most of us played Warsow, where I won every match, then we all switched to Jedi Academy, which also went pretty well. Then everyone else left, and Tobias and I played a round of The Ship, which was somewhat jankier than I expected. I got home at ~00:30.

*** 19 Sun

Church, then we had a guest speaker for Bible Class, a guy who worked with or for the LCMS, who helped with their wills and estate planning and such. After this, we went to Vati and Mutti's for lunch. I brought Ariksander and Justinian as well, as I had offered to take them to Josh's Talisman game and it was more efficient this way. So after lunch, we went to the Osbuns'. We played two games of Talisman: Josh, Matthew, Ariksander, and Doug (Josh's friend) played on the Cataclysm board with the Woodland and Highland expansions, and me, Justinian, Erik, and Doug (Doug's nephew) played on the regular board with the Dungeon and City expansions (the Reaper, Werewolf, and Firelands expansions were shared). I was a Tinkerer, got ~11 S/C, beat the boss of the Dungeon, and went straight to the Demon Lord, who I died against despite the odds being slightly in my favor. While I was fighting the Demon Lord, Justinian looked at a Basilisk and died. Immediately after my death, Erik jumped on Doug and attacked him. Although Erik (Alchemist) only had 2 base Str, he used Full Plate, Psionic Blast, and Warhorse to get that to 11, and then used Freeze on Doug to prevent him from rolling a die. Doug had 1 Life (and no Fate), so Erik killed him and won the game. Additional notes about the game: I was never forced to lose anything during the game, other than Life; Doug's first two characters died (the 2nd one got double 1s at the Reaper); and Erik gained no Strength and only one Craft during his entire run, and had to ask me partway through the game what the blue cones were for. Justinian and I waited for around ~30 minutes before Ariksander died in his game (killed by a Black Unicorn he was taming), then I took them home. On the way we discussed game design. Then I drove home, getting back ~21:15. Early bed with Sarah.

*** 20 Mon

Sarah worked her first full morning shift with PDHH. It was a very nice day, and I took the kids outside to wander around the family's property. We sat in the big field. Cyprian played with stick-tights and Methuselah bit Gwen (not quite hard enough to draw blood). I talked with Luke and Mom on the phone. Found out that Luke and his friends were arriving in time for supper, and we were all invited. Luke and his friends stopped by briefly when they arrived, shortly after Sarah got home, and then everyone went to the family's for supper. Aside from my family, Mom, Elle, and Suha, there was Martin, Luke, Anneke (Luke's girlfriend), Jo (Joanna; Anneke's roommate), and Daniel (not Elle's Daniel; Luke's roommate).

*** 21 Tue

Rainy day, but not too bad. Sarah started the day by going to the police station and courthouse to take care of her "fix it ticket". Then she got back and she, Dad, Luke, Martin, and Daniel worked outside, putting up the light fencing for the goat pasture. Suha or someone brought over leftover french toast from the family. We all had lunch at the family's house, and afterward I was invited to go with the guys (Martin, Luke, Daniel) to the lake farm to take turns on Martin's dirt bike. We did, and it was a lot of fun. No major (or even moderate) spills or injuries. Sarah went to bed in the afternoon, to sleep up for a night shift. While she and Gwen were napping, Suha came over and took Cyprian for a walk (when they returned, Martin was with them, too). I took the kids to the family's for supper (which Sarah slept through). After supper, we watched a few of this year's Augustine's "Restless Hearts Cafe", then I took the kids home and put them to bed. While I was putting them to bed, Dad came over and lit a bonfire of brush and branches in the field between our two houses. Everyone else came out to watch and hang out. I went out for a few minutes, after the kids were in bed. Suha and Martin were sitting together, as were Luke and Anneke.

*** 22 Wed

I spent some time hanging out at Mom and Dad's. Sarah slept until the late afternoon. We were originally going to have Luke and co over to hang out after supper and church, but it was getting late and Sarah and I were getting tired, so we deferred until tomorrow.

*** 23 Thu

Sarah had a short shift at PACE today. Luke and co were going to help out at the Hope Rescue Mission, but there ended up being enough helpers, so they ended up doing something else (going to La Grande, I think). In the evening, after supper and after putting the kids to bed, Sarah and I had Luke and his friends (and Elle and Anna) over to watch A Man For All Seasons.

*** 24 Fri

Sarah worked. I had an uneventful morning and afternoon, and took the kids to the Berrien Springs library for 16:00 Story Time.

*** 25 Sat

Sarah worked. I took the kids over for lunch, and after lunch, Matthew Horner arrived and he and I and Luke and Luke's friends all went out to shoot some guns. It was very cold. We all took turns shooting a few rifles from up near the art barn, then Jo and Anneke went inside and the rest of us went closer and shot some pistols and a revolver. We all got very cold and eventually went inside to warm up, chat, and have some cookies (by this time, Martin had arrived), then we went back out again (this time with Martin and Anneke and Suha). We shot a few more guns, then eventually went back inside and had supper. After supper, I took the kids home, and shortly afterward Sarah arrived. She went to the family's first, and had supper and hung out a bit, then came home.

*** 26 Sun

Gwen's third birthday. Sarah worked. I took the kids to church (Suha and Martin sat with me and watched Cyprian, while Gwen sat on my lap the whole service. I talked with Nick and Hannah a bit, and with Egon during Bible Class (I was in Mutti's office). After church, lunch at Vati and Mutti's, and then I went to Aldi while the kids watched Lady and the Tramp. Mutti gave Cyprian a piano lesson, I took a brief nap, and then I came home. Dropped the kids off at Mom and Dad's, went home to put away groceries, then went back for supper. Was originally going to be supper with Mom, Dad, Elle, and Anna, but ended up just being Elle and Anna (Mom was grumpy so Dad took her on a date). After the meal, I chatted with Elle and Anna a while about stuff (friends, politics).

*** 27 Mon

I went out in the late morning to take care of some errands in preparation for a lunchtime birthday party for Gwen (one such errand was going to the bank and temporarily increasing our spending limit so we can continue to pay off our big hospital bill with the Samaritan money that's coming in). For the party we had: Mutti, Mom, Dad, Elle, Anna, and Grandpa and Grandma Harrison (Vati didn't come since he's getting ready for his colonoscopy tomorrow). It was a very nice party and Gwen and Zip behaved themselves well. After everyone left, Sarah went to bed, the kids went down for naps, and I spent basically the whole day researching guns (eventually deciding that if I am to buy one, it willl be the Ruger Mark IV 22/45 Lite, though I'm not sure what color). Sarah went to PDHH in the evening.

*** 28 Tue

Sarah got back from work just in time to join me and the kids driving to Vati and Mutti's. We got there, then I took Vati to his colonoscopy. While we were there, Vati caught up briefly with a doctor at the facility who was an old friend of his (and whom I later overheard remarking that Vati was "quite a character"). I waited the ~2 hours of the colonoscopy. Meanwhile, Mutti had a radio interview, and Sarah half watched the kids, half napped. I drove Vati back to the house and we all had lunch. I do not recall details of the rest of the day.

** 03 Mar
*** 01 Wed

Ash Wednesday. We went to church in the evening for ashes and the service. Cyprian asked several times if we were going to die (apparently he had made some sort of association with the ashes).

*** 02 Thu

Sarah worked at Memorial.

*** 03 Fri

Sarah worked a day shift at PDHH.

*** 04 Sat

Matthew arrived at about noon for a brief visit. We went over and had lunch with them. Lots of fun. At ~15:00, we went back home, Sarah went to bed, and I and the kids drove to Vati and Mutti's. I left the kids with Vati, and I went to Tobias' for a LAN. In attendance: me, all of the Tribble children, Nicholai, Ariksander, Aaron, and Erik (briefly). Aaron brought his new Nintendo Switch and I played a bit of it. For the LAN, we played a few games of Battle for Middle-earth 2, then Star Wars Battlefront 2, then Far Cry 2. After everyone else left, I played a bit of the new Star Wars Battlefront on Tobias' computer, then he and I played a few rounds of a Sonic kart-racing game.

*** 05 Sun

Church, and then we went to Elizabeth McGrath's house for lunch. Sarah did very well, despite having very little sleep. The kids played together very well. On the way home, we dropped the Expedition off at Town & Country for an oil change, check-up, and to fix the hinges on the rear glass, as well as see if they could address the leaking sunroof.

*** 06 Mon

Vati's birthday. Sarah worked at PDHH.

*** 07 Tue

Sarah worked at Memorial.

*** 08 Wed

Sarah worked at PACE.

*** 09 Thu

Sarah and I had dentist appointments in the morning, and we took the kids with us. They did very well, all things considered.

*** 10 Fri

Sarah worked at PDHH. During this past week - I don't remember the exact days - Sheila Quinn offered me my old job, working directly for her instead of Samlind, but I refused (given the distance and everything). I also applied, at Josh's suggestion, for a job with Tri-County Dispatcher in Wakarusa, and I had a few phonecalls with the supervisor there, but we decided that it wouldn't work right now since what they mainly need is Sunday morning shifts (also, the distance and everything).

*** 11 Sat

We went to the YMCA after breakfast, using the free pass we got when we first came and had a tour. We stayed for 2.5 hours. The kids stayed in the daycare (and did very well) while Sarah and I did cardio, a bit of resistance training, and stretching. When we got home, everyone else napped while I worked downstairs.

*** 12 Sun

Church, then we talked with Nick and Hannah and decided to visit them in the evening. So after Bible Class, Vati took us out to Taco Bell, then he took the kids while Sarah and I shopped at Aldi. We went back to Vati and Mutti's, left the groceries in the car (it was about 33 degrees), and napped for a bit, then we took the kids and went to Nick and Hannah's (it was Sarah's first time seeing the apartment). After we got there, Nick and I went to the nearby Little Caesar's for pizza, and brought it back. We had a good supper and talked about jobs, books, movies, etc. They told us that they were pregnant (not yet public knowledge). Very exciting.

*** 13 Mon

Sarah worked at Memorial. I decided the day would be a potty-training day for Gwen. After breakfast, I sat her down on the potty, in the living room, in front of Toy Story 2, with all the watered down applejuice she wanted (she eventually got through about a liter). She ended up peeing six times: once on the floor, once in a diaper, and four times on the potty. Calling it a success. Dad and Elle, both recently returned from trips, came over for supper. Around suppertime was when Cyprian started showing signs of not feeling well.

*** 14 Tue

Sarah took Gwen to an eye appointment in the morning. Told me that Gwen behaved herself well, although screamed at getting her eyes dilated. Doctor said that Gwen's eyes seem mostly okay - stereo vision is not completely intact, but it looks like she'll be able to drive (etc) when she's older. Having her back in three months. Meanwhile, at home, Cyprian had a bit of a fever, and was clearly not feeling 100%. Sarah got home and took care of him, and I went to Bethel and passed my American Government CLEP. Then I locked my keys in the car. So I borrowed Vati's car and drove home, stopping at Walgreens (passport photos), a post office (mailing in passport renewel form), and Walmart (exercise pants). Got home, kissed Sarah, got the spare Subaru key, and drove back to Bethel (stopping at Chemical Bank to deposit some Samaritan checks). Got back and gave Vati's keys back and talked with him for about 45 minutes. Drove home, had supper with Sarah and the kids and Elle. Elle talked about her visit with Daniel. Sarah ordered some checks while I wasted time online, then we went to bed.

*** 15 Wed

Sarah worked at PDHH. I stayed at home with the kids and worked on Gwen's potty training. I was very tired all day.

*** 16 Thu

Sarah worked at PDHH. Kids have colds around this time.

*** 17 Fri

I went down to Bethel to take my Natrual Sciences CLEP. It took a very long time, because they (Bethel and whoever's in charge of CLEPs) were having technical issues - I had to wait for about 90 minutes before I could take my test. I passed it, had lunch, and then came home. Suha watched the kids while Sarah and I went to the theater and saw "Logan", and then got Chinese food from the restaurant across the street, and talked about the movie.

*** 18 Sat

Sarah worked at Memorial. I brought lunch over to the family's (Elle and Suha, with Mom around but not eating with us). Then I left the kids with Suha for a few hours while I came home and did some work.

*** 19 Sun

Sarah worked at Memorial. Cyprian had his most extreme screaming session during church yet (though the actual screaming was after I'd taken him outside). After church, I took the kids to Vati and Mutti's, we had lunch, and then Vati entertained them with movies while I did some grocery shopping, then napped. In the late afternoon, the kids and I went to Mom and Dad's for supper.

*** 20 Mon

Sarah took the kids in the morning, and then she had to go to sleep in the afternoon, in preparation of a night shift. I took the kids and went to the South Bend airport to pick up Mutti (she just got back from a trip and Vati is busy with rehearsals at Bethel). The kids and Mutti were all happy to see each other.

*** 21 Tue

Sarah got back from her night shift, did goat chores with the kids, and then went to bed. I watched the kids and cleaned the house. We (including Sarah) went to Mom and Dad's for supper, then took a walk in the woods with Mom and Dad. By the time we got back, Martin was there, hanging out with Suha. Sarah and I put the kids to bed, and then Sarah left for another night shift. I stayed up very late working on games and taxes and watch repair down in my office.

*** 22 Wed

Sarah got back from her night shift and went to bed. I watched the kids and cleaned the house. Made a large-ish meal for supper. Sarah went to work again in the evening. After the kids went to bed, I brought my desktop from downstairs and put it in the bedroom to try to download League of Legends overnight.

*** 23 Thu

Sarah got back from her night shift and went to bed. I watched the kids, and finally got LoL working. After Sarah woke up, Dad came over and I helped him repair the roofing on our barn (a recent windstorm tore some of the screws out). Sarah had an extra shift unexpectedly put on her schedule for PDHH, but she called and got it taken off. Then Sarah watched the kids while I went downstairs and did some taxes, played some LoL, and read about audiology and hearing protection. We had supper at Mom and Dad's (Elle was there too). Discussion was had about Grandma and Grandpa H, who may finally be ready for assisted living. After we got the kids in bed, Sarah and I watched some Parks and Rec.

*** 24 Fri

Sarah worked at Memorial. I took the kids to Vati and Mutti's. Naomi and her kids (and Amelia Grobien) were also there, so we spent the rest of the afternoon and evening there, then I left the kids and I went home.

*** 25 Sat

Sarah and I got up early and drove an hour north for a CPL class. Slightly charismatic speaker. Very cold and wet - 9 hour class, so we were freezing by the end of it. For the range portion, Sarah stuck with a .22lr, while I tried two different 9mms (and a Ruger Mark IV).

*** 26 Sun

We went to Vati and Mutti's early to get the kids ready. Saw Naomi and the kids.

*** 27 Mon

Sarah worked at Memorial.

*** 28 Tue

Sarah is pregnant!

*** 29 Wed

Sarah worked a day shift at PDHH

*** 30 Thu

Sarah worked a day shift at PDHH. In the evening, shortly before she got back, I dropped the kids off with Mom and went to Great Lakes Heating and Air Conditioning in South Bend for a "hiring event". It was a weird event (apparently the first of its kind). First I played Headbands with some other prospective employees, then Pictionary, then we shot paintballs at clay pigeons, then we (and all the other potential hires) listened to a longish speech by Mike, the boss and owner (son of previous owner). I set up an interview for next week.

*** 31 Fri

Sarah worked at PACE, and slept in preparation for a night shift at PDHH.

** 04 Apr
*** 01 Sat

Sarah got home and slept. Around noon, I dropped the kids off with Mom and Dad, then Sarah and I went to see "Oklahoma!" at Bethel. Afterward, we chatted with Mutti a bit. Then we got a little food, and went to Sky Zone for an hour. Tons of fun. Then we went to Aldi to do our grocery shopping, and came home. Got home at about the right time to put the kids to bed.

*** 02 Sun

Church, then Vati and Mutti's house. Mutti and Sarah andthe kids and I went on a longish walk by the river. We had supper with Elle.

*** 03 Mon

I worked downstairs while Sarah took the kids, then Sarah napped and went to work. I stayed up late working on the computer.

*** 04 Tue

Sarah got home from work at PDHH, slept a bit, then went to shadow at Memorial Wound Clinic. Good experience. She and I watched some Parks and Rec before bed.

*** 05 Wed

Sarah and the kids took Paprika to the vet in the morning, on account of Paprika being pregnant. When they were getting ready to leave, Sarah accidentally put the wrong key in the ignition and got it stuck there. Luckily, she was eventually able to coax it out. Sarah slept in the afternoon/evening and went to work at PDHH.

*** 06 Thu

Sarah worked last night, and tonight. The kids were very unruly.

*** 07 Fri

Before Sarah got back from her night shift, I dropped the kids off with Mom and Dad and drove to Great Lakes for an interview. Went well, as far as I could tell. Then I went to church for Lydia Osbun's baptism (I was 15 minutes late). During church, a woman came in and stole Mutti's keys and car, Mom's keys, and Cecilia Horner's flipphone. This was all discovered after the service. While Mutti talked with the police, I took the kids to Vati and Mutti's house, both to make sure the house was untouched, and to sned Mutti a picture of her car title so she could give the information to the police. I let the kids play at Vati and Mutti's for a while, and I worked on a computer issue with Mutti, and we had lunch. Then we came home. After everyone finished napping, Sarah made supper, I cleaned and watched the kids, Sarah and Elle went on a walk, and then we all went to Mom and Dad's for supper. Then we came back to our house for a book discussion ("Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley). Jill and Ian came.

*** 08 Sat

Sarah worked at Memorial. I dropped the kids off with Mutti, then went to Tobias' house for a LAN. Aside from Tribbles, there were Nick, Ariksander, Justinian, Erik, Matthew, and Nathan Jindra. We played two games of League of Legends, then some Mount and Blade, then Jedi Academy (with my collection of mods), and then, with half the players gone, a bit of Age of Mythology (where I severely annoyed Egon by beating him). Sarah and I both slept at Vati and Mutti's house.

*** 09 Sun

Sarah worked at Memorial. I stayed with the kids at Vati and Mutti's for most of the afternoon, before coming home for supper at Mom and Dad's. It was around this time that Daniel arrived for a two or three week stay, and I think it was today that, after supper, while Elle was playing soccer with the kids outside, I made a comment to him about marriage, and he actually started asking me a bunch of questions. We talked about about 45 minutes about marriage and related topics.

*** 10 Mon

Sarah worked a night shift.

*** 11 Tue

Sarah had some people over in the afternoon to make origami flowers for Easter (Cheryl, Josh, and Merissa Jordan, and the Tribble girls; I think that was it).

*** 12 Wed

Mom hosted the Seder meal. Grandpa and Grandma Harrison were there, as well as Jill Frey. Grandpa's getting noticably demented.

*** 13 Thu

Sarah took the kids for most of the day while I worked downstairs (taxes etc). We went to church in the evening.

*** 14 Fri

Good Friday. Sarah went grocery shopping in the morning to get supplies for pastry baking tomorrow. Then she took a short nap while Suha took the kids. We went to church in the evening. When we got back, Sarah slept a little more, then went to work. I stayed up late playing LoL and doing chores etc. I got a letter today from Great Lakes informing me that they would not be offering me a job.

*** 22 Sat

Sarah left for the afternoon to go get a new goat (Kiko male), as well as draw blood from a few goats. We had Daniel and Mom over for supper. After supper, while Sarah was showing Mom the new goat, Daniel and I talked about rings, proposals, etc., and Daniel borrowed my set of ring sizers. In the evening, I worked on my critique of Ethan's novel, while Sarah took care of some more goat business, and then we watched some Parks and Rec before going to bed.

*** 24 Mon

Sarah was scheduled to work today, but got put on-call. I packed up the kids and went to South Bend, primarily to drop off the Expedition to get $2200 worth of various repairs. Mutti picked us up from the mechanic and we went to her place. While she watched the kids, I picked up my dry cleaning from Zikers. I ended up spending most of the day there, as it took a while for the car to be fixed. I mostly worked on (and finished) my critique of Ethan's novel, and the kids mostly played etc. Curt was over for much of the day, doing yard work for Mutti. I picked up the car right as the Town and Country closed, at 17:30, and then took the kids to the Divine Service at Emmaus, and then came home with them (after stopping at Taco Bell).

*** 25 Tue

Sarah and I took the kids and ran errands today: county clerk in Niles to submit CPL applications, YMCA to submit financial assistance paperwork, bank to deposit a check, sheriff's office in St. Joseph to get fingerprinted for CPLs, restaurant and park in St. Joseph for a little picnic, Family Fleet and Farm for goat-related stuff, then back home. Sarah slept during the evening and went to work at night.

*** 26 Wed

Sarah got home in the morning and slept for a few hours. I made some pilot bread and otherwise watched the children and packed and got ready for our trip. Sarah got up around lunchtime and did the same. It took us a while, but we finally got out the door around 15:45. I left the ukulele at Mom and Dad's so Elle could practise with it if she was so inclined. We had a long and fairly uneventful drive, and got to our halfway point, a hotel in Woodstock, Ontario, at about 23:15. All flopped into bed and fell asleep.

*** 27 Thu

Had continental breakfast at the hotel, then left for more driving. Stopped at Walmart so Sarah could pick up some pajamas (she forgot hers at home). Got to our Ottawa Airbnb at around 18:30. Very nice place. Smart lock. Mom and Dad arrived not long after, and then Anna. We quickly chucked our belongings around, then left for supper at a local friend's house (Sophie and Richard. I think the connect is their son, Josh, who went to Augustine.). Nice visit. Friendly dog. Talked rather late. Didn't leave until almost 23:00. Got back to the house and we all ran around getting things settled. The pump for our air mattress died (or rather, one of the batteries started leaking), so we pulled up the air mattress from downstairs (we wanted to let the kids sleep in the same room as us). I stayed up a bit journaling and reading LoL stuff.

*** 28 Fri

!!! got up, hiked with Luke 3 hours, kids did 75% walking by themselves. Fire tower. look up km? Gatinau or whatever. After walk, late lunch in park, talked a bit of politics (weed etc), went home and napped. Then Sarah went to the Bulk Barn and bought food for the casual party later today. Came home and cooked it up (various pasta dishes), and we went to Ecclesiax. Saw some friends, had a party, talked with Joel and Anneke, etc. Saw Zach right at the end before we went back to the Airbnb for bed.

*** 29 Sat

!!! Went out for breakfast brunch with Joel and Anneke and their son James. We went to "Life of Pie". Then we went on a walk with them by a river. Then we went back to the home, got ready, and went to the graduation. I dropped Sarah off and then had a hard time finding parking. Had to walk several blocks with the kids, and got their only just in time. Graduation was good, although Dr. Patrick was a bit rambly. Pictures etc afterward, then everyone went to Ecclesiax for the nice reception. Anna called dances with a live band. Near the end, Mom and Dad took the kids back, while Sarah and I went with everyone to a nearby pub (the something and the something) for drinks, although Sarah and I and Joel stuck with nonalcoholic stuff. Stayed until about 01:00, mostly chatting with Joel (Anneke was at her night shift). During the party, Zippy and Gwen played in the play room with Emily for a long time.

*** 30 Sun

!!! Elle left early in the morning. We went to Luke's church. Kind of lackluster, nice people though. Then Luke had to say goodbye, and we went back to the Airbnb. In the evening, we went to Andre and Kendra's for one more party. Zip and Gwen had a great time playing with toys, emily, James, and Thomas, Bennet Candy's son. Also the dogs and the cat and the snake. We stayed for a while, and had a short hymn sing. When we got home, we watched Wallace and Gromit with Anna and Matthew and Matthew's tag-alongs from Liberty, Charles and Hannah.

** 05 May
*** 01 Mon

!!! Everyone else except for Anna left early, before we got up, and Anna left not long after we got up. We spent a few hours packing up, then left at 11:00. Drove the whole way, arriving home at ~01:30. Kids did alright, considering.

*** 02 Tue

Sarah and I dragged ourselves out of bed and had an uneventful day at home. Sarah slept in the afternoon and evening, in preparation for a night shift. Elle came over to say goodbye, as she's off to Mackinac for the summer.

*** 03 Wed

Sarah got home in the morning and slept until the afternoon. I watched the kids and cleaned up the house. Gwen refused to eat her rice from yesterday, and consequently ate nothing today. Sarah and I both tried to talk her into eating the rice, and we even called Mom to have her talk to Gwen, but we were unsuccessful. Maybe tomorrow? I took a nap in the afternoon (after Sarah woke up), during which time Sarah mowed about half the lawn (eventually giving up due to the inadequacy of our badly-unsharpened lawnmower). After we put the kids down for bedtime, we watched some Parks and Rec while I practised braiding her hair. She eventually went to bed, while I stayed up too late playing LoL and taking care of stuff on the computer.

*** 09 Tue

First pre-natal appointment at Fairhaven for child #3.

*** 11 Thu

Sarah was scheduled to go into work today, but ended up staying home, as the baby she takes care of is in the hospital (probably not serious). So she stayed home and mowed the lawn and did other outdoors stuff with the kids. I worked downstairs, doing stuff on the computer and cleaning up a bunch of water in the basement, and stuff the water got wet. In the afternoon, Sarah took the kids to animal control and picked up two full-grown cats for the barn (as well as renewing Curdie's dog license). She also picked up some flowers for Grandma Harrison for Mother's Day. We had supper with Mom, and then when Dad arrived we all went on a walk through the woods. Mom talked to me about paying me to do some administrative work for her for AAPLG (organizing files, mostly).

*** 21 Sun

We drove to Grand Rapids area for church, and then Martin and Suha's wedding. Small; the groom's side was literally the Horners (sans Erik and Cecilia, due to scheduling conflicts), the Harrisons (sans Matt and Luke, but including Elle, Anna, and Daniel), and the Rheins (me, Sarah, Cyprian, Gwen). When Cyprian saw Suha appear in her wedding dress at the back of the sanctuary he enthusiastically waved to her and tried to show her a picture of a train he had drawn. After the service, some pictures were taken outside, then we had a brief, friendly reception downstairs, before we had to leave. Sarah went to work that night. I tried to play LoL with Nick, but my ping never settled down so I gave up.

*** 24 Wed

Luke and Anna chatted about stuff.

*** 25 Thu

Helped Dad and Luke fix Matt's hanger door (partially)

*** 26 Fri

"In the evening, Anna and Luke came over and while we were going to watch Logan, we instead decided to watch a movie none of us had seen: The Grand Budapest Hotel. We talked about it a bit afterward. Anna liked it a bit more than Luke and me.

Anna told us earlier today about having gone on three dates with three different guys in immediate succession."

*** 27 Sat

Mom and Luke took the kids in the morning to go fishing. Sarah got home and I napped with her until the kids came back. We all had supper over at the family's, with Mom and Luke, and we discussed some theological topics (the literal-ness of the Creation account, that sort of thing). Then Dad got home and we all went on a walk through the woods, while Luke talked to me and Sarah about music and art, secular vs "Christian", etc. After Sarah went to work and the kids went to bed, I played LoL downstairs.

*** 28 Sun

Sarah got home in time for all of us to go to church together. After the service, I chatted with Nick and others about LoL for a little bit, then went down for Bible Class. After Bible Class, Sarah and I took the kids to the Chinese buffet on Ireland Rd, and had a nice lunch, although Gwen ate little and Cyprian ate nothing (big breakfast, I guess). Then we went to Aldi for groceries, then home for naps. We had supper at the family's.

*** 29 Mon

I cleaned and Sarah worked outside with the kids in the morning; for supper, we had over Luke, Matthew Horner (he and Luke had gone mountain biking in the morning), and JD Hall (who was partway through mowing our lawn at the time). After lunch, Sarah went outside for a little longer, then went to bed for her night shift. After supper, I took the kids on a walk in the woods.

*** 30 Tue

Sarah worked last night, and tonight. I stayed at home with the kids. I think I took them on a walk in the woods.

*** 31 Wed

Sarah worked last night. I took the kids to the Niles park, and afterwards got some Taco Bell (including some stuff for Sarah). I worked a bit at the office in the evening.

** 06 Jun
*** 01 Thu

We learned today that Mike Matter, Oscar's father, died after length emergency surgery following a dissected aorta (that same thing Oscar's getting surgery for tomorrow).

*** 02 Fri

Sarah worked at PDHH during the morning. I took the kids to the Niles library, then to Walmart. Oscar Matter had his surgery. It went well.

*** 03 Sat

I got up early, ran, then went to work at the office all day. Sarah went to garage sales with the kids.

** 09 Sep
*** 04 Mon

Finally got back to doing my journal. Backfilled the last couple of days.

* 2018
** 02 Feb
*** 05 Wed

Had a call from Alliance Home Health Care Services, setting up an interview for Wednesday.

*** 06 Tue

I got up at my regular time, but instead of going early to the office, stuck around at home and had breakfast with the kids. At about 09:25, I left for my 3rd-ish interview with GreenEcho/CED (the 1st being a phone screening with Emily Roos, and the 2nd being an in-person interview with Laura Mullins, with Jill Moore confrencing in).

My 3rd interview started with two standardized tests which, Laura informed me, every employee working for/with CED had to take. The first was the Wonderlic test. I felt good about my performance on it. Laura told me she'd never seen anyone finish all 50 questions, and I finished 48. I also saw the last two questions, and they didn't seem to be especially difficult; I think I could have answered them with 30 more seconds. Anyway, I know I got #48 wrong, so depending on how they score it, the best score I can hope for is either 47 or 46, and 40 is probably a more realistic figure to shoot for.

The 2nd test, I don't remember what it was called, but it was pretty similar to the Wonderlic in terms of content. A bit easier, I'd say, but much longer. I want to say there were either 100 or 200 questions total, with 20 minutes. I answered about 80% of them, then when I saw I had only seconds to go, I filled in as many more as I could at random (Laura had told me that my score on this test was simply the number of questions I got right). I should have budgeted enough time to randomly guess at every remaining question, but I kept second-guessing Laura's statement about how the test was scored.

After the tests, I shadowed an employee named Jason for around two hours, while he took calls. Jason seems like a nice guy. Bit of IT background. Three kids (oldest is 15, 12, and ~9). Wife worked (works?) as a CNA for a while. He's currently getting his Bachelor's. He's friendly on the phone, and apparently he does well. He told me that he's only been with GreenEcho/CED for 8 months, but they already have him training people. Glancing at the other desks in the office, I see that Jason has done very little personalization. He has no pictures or knick-knacks up, with the exception of a little blue wooden or plastic figure that looks kind of like a water drop with eyes. It looks kind of like a Pokemon or something from a Studio Ghibli film. Other than that, his desktop background is for a sports team, and that's the end of his customization.

I watched Jason take calls, and talked with him, and the job seems like something I could do. Like any possible, looming task, it seems sort of huge and impossible to me, but realistically, it's pretty much up my alley. After I was done shadowing Jason, I talked with Laura for just a few minutes (she asked if I was still interested, to which I said yes; she said they had some more people to interview, but I should expect a call in about a week) before leaving.

I ate lunch in my car while watching videos on YouTube and Netflix. Then I called Sarah and drove to the AAPLOG office. When I got there, I realized I was very tired, so I slept in the car for about 30 minutes before going in.

I spent about three hours working at AAPLOG, mostly on Mom's travel organization thing. It was good. I was at a stage where I just needed to ask her a lot of questions about details of individual conferences and things. She also had me take and print 2x2 pictures of her for a Visa application (or something like that), and I got TeamViewer installed on her computers.

Mom joined Sarah and me and the kids for supper. I told them both about the interview, and all that. In the evening, I got another call from Alliance Home Health Care Services, just asking me if I had a current TB test (I don't). Sarah and I put the kids to bed, and talked about an article that Lizzie Seyboldt had shared ("The Female Price of Male Pleasure").

** 03 Mar
*** 02 Fri

At the dinner table, Sarah and I mentioned to the kids that when Beatrix was crawling, they must never leave small things like coins on the ground, as she could choke on them and die. The kids interrupted with unrelated comments, and we kind of figured they weren't listening. But about 15 minutes later, while they were watching The Incredibles, Cyprian came over to us, almost crying, and say, "I have an idea. If Trixie has a small thing, we should get it away from her." He told us later, again on the verge of tears, that he was scared of Trixie choking and dying. Sarah and I were both surprised that he took the lesson to heart so quickly and completely. I'm surprised he's internalized the concept of death enough to anticipate sadness in that way (I assume that's what's making him sad).

** 04 Apr
*** 01 Sun (Easter Sunday; April Fool's Day)

Sarah's work prevented her from going to any but the main Sunday Easter service at Emmaus, and I didn't want to try to take the kids, by myself, to either the vigil or sunrise services. So I met up with Sarah on Sunday morning. The service was nice. Packed, as usual. Easter brunch afterwards. Sarah (and, later, Dad, Elle, and Daniel) got talking to two guests, male grad students from Notre Dame, one a nominal ELCA Lutheran, the other a Muslim (who wanted Sarah to explaoin the Holy Ghost to him).

Napped after church, then had supper at Mom and Dad's. Present:
Mom & Dad, Vati & Mutti, Elle & Daniel, Jill
Matt spent the day with the Stuckwisches and Luke left after church for his 2-month outdoor thing.

Supper was very pleasant. As an April Fool's joke, Vati and Mutti brought a bag of little plastic bouncy rabbits, which they proceeded to hide all over the place. Later all of us got into kind of a battle with them, bouncing them at each other. I think Jill had a good time in particular, and I'm glad that Zip and Gwen are so eager to include her in things. I feel guilty for not yet contacting Adam Stuck, as I promised her I would.

Before bed, I did a bit more studying for my CLEP. First one tomorrow (if I can get it rescheduled - will see in the morning...).

*** 02 Mon

Dad took the kids to see Grandma and Grandpa Harrison while Sarah and I and Trixie went to South Bend/Mishawaka. I took a CLEP at Bethel (American History 1 - passed), then Sarah and I went to a marriage counseling session, then I took Sarah to Hensell's Oaken Bucket. We came home, the kids came home, lunch, naptime. Got an email about car insurance being overdue. We watched The Crown before going to bed.

*** 03 Tue

Up early with Trixie. Then off to Bethel for a CLEP (American History 2, passed, barely). Went in the Expedition, and afterwards dropped it off at Town & Country to have them look at the transmission. Unfortunately, they don't have any record of working on the transmission previously, so if it WAS worked on, it was at Dee's. After the CLEP, Mom picked me up (Sarah was at work; Mom had taken all three kids to the morning service), and I drove home, stopping first at Paul's grave (Mom had some flowers to put there) and then at the AAPLOG office (to drop Mom off).

Back home and I watched the kids. Called Ty Reneberg about the Expedition, trying to find out if Dee's had worked on the transmission previously (he said he'd call me back). Sarah came home and brought Mom for supper. I sent Deanna Dobberstein an email and we watched The Crown before going to bed.

*** 04 Wed

Took the kids to Vati and Mutti's where Mutti could babysit them while I took another CLEP (English Lit - passed). Picked up the kids again and went home. Was supposed to pick up Sarah from work, but forgot; Mom picked her up.

*** 10 Tue

Mostly cleaned while Sarah slept. We all took a walk in the evening, going out to the electric tower. Saw the dead deer in the woods, and then three more right next to each other in the soy bean field. Mom and Dad came by to say hi. They're training for a hiking trip with Luke, just before Luke enlists.

Got a call from Town & Country about the Expedition. They changed the oil and filter, but it still has some trouble once you get to 50-60 mph. They want us to drive it for 1-2 weeks to see if it seems like the transmission is okay (in which case we can fix the transmission oil lines) or close to failure (in which case we either need to replace it or replace the car).

*** 14 Sat

Trixie turned herself over for the first time today (back to front).

** 06

Sun
Church, Martin and Suha were there, we tried to have lunch with them, didn't work out. Some time at Vati and Mutti's. They cleaned out their garage and put a new floor down. Maybe we'll do the same? Got some bike helmets and stuff. In the evening I took the kids over to the family's for a subdued supper, and Mom played with Zip and Gwen a lot. GENERAL UPDATE? Zip lost a tooth today. Trixie's working on solid food, saying dada, and almost sort of sitting up. Gwen?

Mon
Uneventful day?

Tue
Sarah slept in the morning, then we dropped Zip and Gwen off with Mutti so we could go to counseling, then we got Zip and Gwen so we could go to the first ND study for Trixie (McDonald's on the way), then back by Mutti's for the nebulizer, then back home. Sarah and Mutti set a time to talk with Dave Smith about Pr. Seyboldt.

*** 28 Thu

Sarah went early to do a drug test for her new job that she very nearly officially has. I spent the whole afternoon in Mishawaka, taking the Expedition to Town & Country to get fixed (bad battery, and some issues with the muffler and exhaust). My extra time I spent in a classroom, studying for the GRE. Sarah and I spent our extra evening time cleaning and packing for the trip tomorrow.

*** 29 Fri

Today was the first day of our vacation with Naomi, her kids, and Vati and Mutti, to Mackinaw. We finished packing in the morning, and left at about noon. Zip and Gwen were eager to get on the road, and buckled themselevs in the car earlier than was strictly necessary. The long drive was hard on them, but they acquitted themselves well, not screaming or sobbing or fighting, but merely asking us over and over how many minutes were left in the the trip, and expressing their concerns that we had been in the car too long. On the way out, we noticed that the proof of insurance we had in the car (from Farm Bureau; still working on the State Farm transition) had expired two weeks ago, so we went by the Farm Bureau office and got an updated copy.

We met Naomi, her kids, Vati and Mutti, and Elle and Daniel at a campsite in Mackinaw City where Sarah had reserved a camper through AirBnB. This was the first time Sarah and I had seen Elle since she announced her pregnancy, and she's just starting to show. Everyone had a good time. Sarah has put together a really good trip, along with a lot of really well-planned meals (supper tonight was hotdogs, hamburgers, beans, watermelon, and chips, followed by s'mores). Elle and Daniel went back to the island, and Vati and Mutti went back to their hotel room, taking Sammy and Zippy (Sammy wanted to stay with them because they had a TV in their room; Zippy wanted to go with them to be with Sammy; Sarah and I wanted them to go because we had overestimated the capacity of the camper and it was going to be a tight fit as it was).

Mutti told us today that Nicholas and Beth announced their first pregnancy together. The news hit Naomi pretty hard, I guess. Sarah and I talked about it with each other and expressed similar feelings of ... perhaps "unease" is the best word. Although I do not hope for Nick and Beth to have bad fortune or be miserable - there is no profit in such things - I am not optimistic for their handling of their marriage and parenting, given their track records. Admittedly, I have little contact with Nick, and none with Beth, and my information about them comes through biased sources (Naomi, Vati, and Mutti).

The campground is nice, though not particularly... campy. It's certainly not a Dad campground. The sites are miniscule, but fully-furnished (or at least the ones in this section are) with water and electricity. The grass is all beautifully mown. There is easy access to an open-late store, showers with hot water, a beach, a swimming pool, a mini golf course, and some other stuff. It's very vacationy.

In the camper, Sita and Susie got individual bunks, Naomi and Annabelle shared the dining-table-turned-bed, and Sarah and I took the biggest bed with Gwen and (when she was hungry) Trixie.

This trip will be a good opportunity to test and update my personal packing list, and decide what things I need to get next.

It seems like the internet in this particular spot is pretty bad, so I'll try to make a few detailed notes to enter into my health journal later.
+ Sarah and I got to bed very late last night, around 3 I want to say, after making love. But only maybe 2 hours of quality time?
+ This morning I got up at 7, and Sarah at 8. 3 hours quality time? 2-3. We had a lot of time in the car, but that wasn't exactly private, and the rest of the day was even less so.

*** 30 Sat

We went to Mackinac Island a little before lunch (slightly delayed by missing a shuttle and a boat; ultimately this only cost us 30 minutes). We met up with Elle, and went to the Fort, staying there for much of the day. I spent most of my energy keeping track of kids, so it's hard for me to make critical judgments, but I think things were handled pretty well and that all the kids enjoyed themselves at least as much as was expected. Our group, or part of it, saw or participated in two tours, a dance, two cannon firings, a musket firing, and an old-fashioned game (play with two sticks and a hoop), not to mention the various houses, exhibits, and movies. Sara kept us well supplied with snacks, and the kids did pretty well, considering the heat (it was at least 80 on the island; closer to 90 in some places, I think.

blah blah blah, Zippy and Sammy semi rough play, the long carriage ride, not even sure if I should criticize, people don't want to talk... Elle blacksmithing, Daniel coming by, Becca, pizza buffet, everyone talking except for me, changing Monday's plan, and the foggy ride home. Then very late showers etc.
