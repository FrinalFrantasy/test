* reading Dating After Marriage

I feel like intimate conversation is my number 1 need, as well. But it has to be meaningful. And recreational companionship is great, but I don't like my recreation to be mindless. I'd rather do something else, in that case.
* Ballad of Stay-at-Home-Dad


:v1:
Why is she crying, oh my baby?
It is still nap time
Why is she crying, oh my baby?
Sleep
Go to sleep

Oh please stop crying, oh my darlin'.
It is still early dayyyy
Oh please stop crying, oh my darlin'
Chill
Just chill out

Why can I hear my baby cryin'
When it's still nap time?

Chill,

I do not know what's in her diaper.
I only know she must be clean.
So I suppose I'll have to wipe her
Or it will turn red -
Yes, it will turn red -
The reddest butt you've ever seen.

Oh to be slave to all these children
Sposin I lose what I've been buildin
S'posin' I lose my hard-won nap-time
Sposin I lose my 
Lookit that big hand move along
Nearing nap-time

Oh to be slave to all these children
Bouncing off walls all in this buildin'
Gotta get ready for my wife -

Soon she'll be home.

Oh to be slave to all these children
Bouncing off walls within this buildin'

Oh to be torn 'twixt kids and cleaning

Gotta get things clean for my wife -
Soon she'll be home.

Vow'd I'd be true 'till death did part her
From me, but now I wonder, oh,
How long can man live without sleep?

* lock and key theory

A book containing many secrets is precious. A secret written in many books is worthless.

A sharpener that's sharpened many pencils is useful. A pencil sharpened by many sharpeners is useless.

A person who understands many riddles is a genius. A riddle understood by many people is simple.

Also...
A lock is still useful even if no key fits it. A key is not.

SGs are absolutely my favourite trail shoes. They are not as wide as the lems - I can barely touch the edges of the lems' forefoot with my toes splayed - but the socklike feel means you don't feel too constricted.

They're truly awesome.

A small number of websites load lower-resolution versions of certain images over my mobile internet connection (Cricket Wireless, a subsidy of AT&T that uses their network) than when they use any other network. I use a tethering connection from my phone to my other computers, and this effect is consistent on my Windows 10 desktop, my Chromebook, and on the Android phone itself. As soon as I switch any of these to any other internet connection, they load the full-resolution images from the websites.

*01 Iron Man
-Stark, with the first suit, v terrorists: at first it seems entirely trivial, with them completely unable to damage him. Then there is trivial+1 against the terrorist boss, who misses Stark with an RPG. Then outside, Stark is shown to take cumulative (but very much nonfatal) damage from sustained high-caliber automatic arms. Note the mysteriously bullet-proof nature of his armor. Then he jets away and the suit disintegrates.
-Note how useful the pieces of the garbage suit were to the bad guys.
-Note SHIELD already being aware of the power/potential of the suit.
-The only alternative to the suit being magic is for Tony to have separately massively improved servos, armor, usability...
-First real suit v terrorists: trivial
-v tank: knocks him out of the sky, dirties him, but no apparent real damage
-v US jets: implied danger, temporary damage (repulsors), permanent but nonspecific damage (bullets); note that IM definitely would've won if he was trying to
-v Iron Monger (with Stark's armor at low power; but low power seems to affect quantity rather than quality); Iron Monger definitely wins, by implied and permanent nonspecific damage. Stark wins by using the big arc reactor. Not sure how to classify.
02 The Incredible Hulk
-Hulk v humans
03 Iron Man 2
-Romanoff v Stark's helper: trivial win.
-suitless Stark v Whisplash 1: Whiplash surprisingly resilient v multiple car impacts, one at high speed; Stark has no real ability to respond, other than environmental
-Stark v Whiplash 1: Whiplash scores massive permanent nonspecific damage, as well as having specific advantages (immobilization, arguably); Stark wins when he wraps himself in the cords and pulls out Whiplash's arc reactor, but it's hard to classify
-Stark v Rhodes: Stark is drunk, but it doesn't seem to affect his fighting; implication is that the suit transcends the alcohol. Stark arguably barely wins the fistfight, before being brought even by situational factors (screaming guests). Then there's the blast-off, which seems to affect Stark more than Rhodes.
-Romanoff v noncombat (Sam) and nameless guards: trivial win
-Stark's helper v nameless guard: attrition win
-Stark and Rhodes v many drones: some implied danger, but apparently trivial; might have some scratches, dunno
-Stark and Rhodes v Whiplash2: Whiplash apparently wins without too much effort (not quite trivially), then he loses via special move.
04 Thor
-Destroyer v frost giants: trivial
-Thor, Loki, Sif, W3 v frost giants: Thor has no real trouble with any of them, gets knocked back once or twice; Loki is arguable; the rest are better, but cannot win indefinitely
-Mortal Thor v nameless Shield goons: trivial
-Mortal Thor v big nameless Shield goon: fairly narrow win
-Destroyer v Shield goons: trivial
-Destroyer v W3 and Sif; largely trivial; they can only delay it
-Thor v Destroyer: trivial or almost; possibly due to special counters?
-Heimdall v IGs; trivial or almost
-Odin's wife v IGs; gets one, got by the other; hard to say
-Thor v Loki+staff: Thor, due to lightning etc.
05 Captain America - The First Avenger
06 The Avengers
07 Iron Man 3
08 Thor - The Dark World
09 Captain America - The Winter Soldier
10 Guardians of the Galaxy
11 Avengers - Age of Ultron
12 Ant-Man
13 Captain America - Civil War
14 Doctor Strange
15 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

1 trivial - loser does not noticable damage to winner
large - winner takes only a little effort to defeat loser
medium - winner takes real effort to defeat loser, but does not seem to be in real danger of losing
narrow - winner wins by minor advantage or attrition
even fight - no apparent winner


no-fight ambushes, especially pre-equipment, don't matter...
elements who only fight one opponent, especiall only once, are of limited value


only opponents to remove Cap's shield: Red Skull (used), Loki (?), Ultron, Bucky (used), Spidey (?)

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1152
"Many supporters and opponents of President Trump's executive order are conflating the terms "immigrant" (which encompasses green card holders), "nonimmigrant," and "refugee."  It's not lawful to ban immigrants because of "nationality, place of birth, or place of residence." This nondiscrimination provision comes from a 1965 law (8 U.S.C. 1152 Sec. 202(a)(1)(A)) that limits the 1952 law (8 U.S.C. 1182 Sec. 212(f)) that the president cites.  It's lawful to ban nonimmigrants for almost any reason. These are people who are temporarily visiting the United States, like tourists or students.  It's lawful to ban refugees for almost any reason. But banning all refugees from particular countries is harsh and unwise. We still should admit well-vetted persons.  Understanding these distinctions is important because supporters of President Trump's executive order continue to wrongly insist that the order is lawful and that President Obama did almost the same thing in 2011. And opponents of President Trump's executive order continue to wrongly insist that banning refugees violates the Constitution or the law.  President Trump's executive order covers not only refugees but also immigrants and nonimmigrants. As noted above, it's not lawful to discriminate in the issuance of an *immigrant* visa because of the person's "nationality, place of birth, or place of residence."  President Obama's action (which wasn't disclosed at the time) covered only refugees and, therefore, did not violate the Constitution or the law, even if one finds it objectionable for other reasons."

The Litany Against Fear:
"I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

I only know as much as I've been able to research in the past hour, so I'm not super confident in my opinion one way or another, but here are the points and questions that strike me as important.

- Section 230 "makes online services immune from civil liability for the actions of their users" (Wikipedia).

- The proposed legislation (SESTA) would change Section 230 "to exclude enforcement of federal or state sex trafficking laws from its immunity" (Wikipedia).

- EFF says that the "federal criminal sex trafficking statute" (18 U.S.C. § 1591) can be used "to go after websites that host ads knowing that such ads involve sex trafficking". However, it's not clear to me whether this has had a positive effect against backpage.com, and if not, why not.

- The "adult" section of the US version of backpage.com was shut down in January of this year. It's unclear to me what effect this had on the sex trafficking.

- I have not been able to find nearly as many accusations of sex trafficking against craigslist, despite it being larger than backpage.com and functionally similar.

- Opponents of SESTA say that 1. it's fundamentally unfair to hold website owners responsible for the actions of their sites' users, and 2. the bill would jeopardize the existence of any website or service that allows user-made content, except perhaps those wealthy enough to hire lawyers to protect themselves. I am sympthatic to both of these arguments.

Hard to find anything to say without feeling unduly sorry for myself.

When I get my 40-50 hour job, I still will not be the breadwinner as defined by His Needs, Her Needs, nor will I be until I can make at least ~$17 /hr.

No reason to expect I will be better at getting other stuff done when I have a job. Weekdays with kids: watch them from 8-6 (10 hours), with the possibility of 1-2 hours of reprieve, depending on the day. Weekday job: 7:30-5:00 (assuming half an hour commute time) (9.5 hours). In the first cat, I then have two days with you that are semi-free. In the second cat, those two days are childcare days.

My executive function is self-evidently terrible. I'm only just now figuring out how to wake up when I want to, and get my schoolwork done on time (barely).

Many of my feelings are just feeling sorry for myself, or suffering that I have no right to complain about and therefore won't.
















Ignoring interest compounding, borrowing at 20 percent per year would lead to doubling in five years; someone who knew about interest on interest might have selected a number less than five. Someone who knows the 'rule of 72' heuristic would know that it would be about 3.6 years, which makes the correct answer "2 to 4 years." In finance, the rule of 72 is a method for estimating an investment's doubling time. The rule number (i.e., 72) is divided by the interest percentage per period to obtain the approximate number of periods (usually years) required for doubling. The other responses reflect a misunderstanding of the concept of interest accrual.

Misc Ireland notes...

Last year I bought some linen from the local fabric shop. I cut it into three pieces for a face cloth, small hand towel, and large bath towel. The total dimensions prior to cutting was aprox. 54 inches square. I used the golden ratio when I cut. (basically cut 1/3 off the large piece. Then did the same again to the small piece). Then took the pieces to a local tailor who serged the edges for around $10.

many people become enamored of writing or the writing life... when they come to understand what it actually take a to write, whether they continue will depend on whether the thing they became enamored of was what they thought writing was like, or having written... and if the latter, if they like it enough to do what it turns out you have to do to produce quality writing.

It's easier to accept and even like a rhythm, a daily or weekly schedule, when you're older, because those lengths of time are more meaningful. I mean... when you're older, time dilates a bit, and it's possible to actually perceive, say, the progress made in practicing the guitar 5 days a week for 30 minutes, whereas it's difficult to perceive this from the more limited viewpoint of a child. So the adult is, in a sense, not more mature, because they're ALSO doing it just for the pleasure... it's just that their time-frame puts the gratification closer (relatively) to the action, and so makes it more gratifying.

A while ago, I told anyone I could get ahold of that if Trump somehow won the candidacy, he'd be handing the presidency to whoever the Democratic nominee was. I said this based on my intuition. But I also said that Trump's chances of winning the candidacy were extremely low, and I based this not on my intuition, but on the available probabilistic data. Since this latter has proven so 
...

I am on record as saying that if Trump won the nomination, he'd be handing the presidency to the Democrats. Now I'm not so sure. The polls, and common sense, suggest that he can't possibly beat either Clinton or Sanders... but polls and common sense were what said he couldn't possibly become the nominee. Now, that may have had something to do with the unusual dynamics of the Republican race, but I keep thinking that there's something bigger and subtler at play, something that doesn't show up on the usual tests because Trump's behavior falls outside of their calibration.

The popular passtime is to analyze Trump and his supporters; to figure out just what went wrong. Opinions are divided on whether Trump is a genius or an idiot, and wh

People are divided as to whether Trump's success is due to him being a genius who understands more than anyone else how to get votes (which is why so many people were surprised when he got them), or due to him being a moron, and 








From a purely rational standpoint, I do have some sort of inuitive feeling that life is good (and that a complex life is better than being hooked up to a Permanent Pleasure Machine—but that may be a different subject), and so am not necessarily incline to debate the issue. However, this is very similar to my intuitive sense that consciousness exists, and that I have, or rather am, one, and that it is the important part of me, and neither material nor pattern.

Torture-mote thing... Just assume that the mote thing is the smallest thing which, when summed with all its ripple effects, does not round down to zero. And if you're concerned that the number of mote-victims isn't high enough (you shouldn't be), rephrase the question to be "is there any number of mote-victims which tip the scales towards preferring torture?"



the selfish immortal...
There was an ancient and glorious civilization; universe-spanning; strictly utilitarian; incredibly long-lived, but mortal. They discover the secret to immortality, immortality to such an extent that may or may not be actually infinite, but absolutely survives the death of this an other universes; but for mysterious reasons, they also disocver—and confirm to an absolute fact—that the process for granting this immortality can only ever be used on one individual, ever, and that doing so will cause painful death for every other member of the civilization (and, perhaps, the entire universe). Then suppose that one selfish individual in this civilization, the worst of them by any measure of goodness, mercy, or even altruism (but perhaps the best in cunning) sabotages the mechanism for this immortality so that it can only ever work on him. So the civilization, being strictly utilitarian, immediately throws the switch—after all, an infinity (or arbitrarily large) amount of life for this (admittedly evil) individual is strictly better than any finite amount of life for everyone else, and to delay for even a single second includes the infinitesimal but real chance that this individual will die or the machinery will break down or whatever. Better idea: rather than "sabotaging" the machinery, the evil-doer murders the good and carefully-selected individual and takes his place just before the mechanism is to activate. Well, that makes a slightly better story, but perhaps a slightly worse thought experiment...

Although I was already familiar with all of the concepts covered in the "Problem Solving" section of our textbook, it was helpful to go over them again in a brief but comprehensive way. I tend to understand these things in a conceptual and intuitive way, which lets me muddle through most problems I come across, but usually very slowly and with frequent errors. In particular, I'm glad that the book went over dimensional analysis, because in deciphering the book's solutions, I was re-familiarized with the standard (and almost certainly most efficient) formulas for solving these problems.

The particular formulas that I'm thinking of are these:

A/B = ?/C = CA/B
A/B = C/? = CB/A








The Living Dictionary
The Living Dictionary was a probably too-ambitious project to make the largest and most dynamic dictionary in the world. It actively and in real-time scanned publications, internet posts, TV dialogue, and even what incidental human speech that it could. Instead of having two categories (included and disincluded) or three (included, disincluded, and included with some qualifier e.g. "uncommon"), it had a smooth range from the "most included" (words which anyone would recognize as an active part of English) to "least included", words which were only just then spoken or made up or used from other languages. As a software dictionary, you set a sliding scale to determine how much "inclusion" you wanted to include. The strictest level would only include those words which you would find, unqualified, in a standard, small dictionary; the broadest level would be changing by the second, and its (admittedly unattainable) goal was to include every word spoken or written by anyone. This would include every foreign word spoken in a mostly-English conversation, as a potential loanword. Since it would be too much data to be organized entirely or even mostly by humans, the primary engine was an AI, which consulted human collaborators on key words or sentences or concepts which it had difficulty parsing. The AI also included an understanding of probability sufficient to extrapolate reasonably from its known data into the unknown.

Some dialogue...
A Great for settling arguments.
B I've always thought that people who use dictionaries to settle/support their arguments are stupid.
A You're forgetting that every argument you've ever made has started by consulting a dictionary: the one in your head.
A2 Also, what if the argument is, "Is this word in the dictionary?" or "What's the most commonly accepted academic definition of this word?"


Second-order useless things: learning how to play eg Scrabble very well is a first-order useless thing; learning the spelling (but nothing else about) every English word, or especially every French word, is a useless thing for the purpose of a useless thing, making it a second-order useless thing (although, interestingly, if you learned strong mnemonics in order to learn all those words, that would itself be a useful thing, since mnemonics are undoubtedly more useful than either of the other two things)


Consulting artisans... a secret society (whether SCP or X-Men or whatever) would likely do well to hit up artisans, custom makers, for much of their equipment... assuming they had the money to do so... because their talents and resources would not tend towards product development, and product development is very difficult and costly. There might be some exceptions for technology that the organization had exclusive access to (alien tech, for instance), but they still would be unlikely to be able to get it into a really impressive form-factor; it'll look more like experiments from someone's basement. For the really hard stuff, like iPhone-type electronics miniaturization and user-friendliness, they would rely on custom-makers / artisans.

Come to think of it, this is exactly how Nolan wrote his Batman film: the suit and car were military, the tech was scavenged from a tech company, etc. It wasn't exactly realistic, but still.

I want to say probably not, but remember that there ARE times when this happens, especially when we are very tired or sick or distracted... is it in any way plausible (or even meaningful) to suggest bringing about the same type of mindset purposefully? Regularly?

The type of puzzle where (for instance) you have to read a word rather than saying the color that it is, or vice versa... is there a genral form, or category? Can I practise it?

What would happen if we created a copy of a human brain?

    Or, simulated to whatever level of detail necessary: individual neurons, individual molecules, etc. Simulate some physical laws, or all.
What would happen?
    The resultant THING would behave more or less the same as the human from which it was created.
    The resultant THING would not behave at all like the human from which it was created; it might not "behave" in any way at all. Why?

Kahneman refers to an article in the Atlantic, talking about the near universality of religious beliefs, refers to two separate beliefs (majorly paraphrased): 1. That our actions are guided by nonmaterial spirits which 2. Leave our bodies on death. My thought is that with only the slightest changes, these sentences apply to the non-nihilist materialist: specifically #2: if they believe that there is any more worth to a human than, say, a rock, or dumb computer; in short, if they assign any value whatever to life, sentience, intelligence, etc., then they ARE attributing something nonphysical to the human being, although they would say that it is something which derives entirely FROM the physical; probably the word "pattern" is what would be used.

More Kahneman, the "answering the easier question". Says something like, you're asked if Mark will be a good president, and the question you answer instead is, Do I have positive emotions associated with Mark? I think that this is a worst construction. Also possible confusing correlation with causation. For instance, if I have learned that Mark has a history of violence, I will probably both dislike him, and have legitimate reticence to have him be president. Crude example, but.

I figure you're a victim whenever something happens to you which you did not want to happen and did not fully, freely, and with reasonable knowledge cause to happen. So, you can be a "victim" of a bad President's unfair policies, and you can be a "victim" of a hurricane.

(Granted that this can get philosophically messy if we start talking about free will and self-control, etc., but I don't think that's an issue in this discussion.)

(Also, I might go further and suggest that victim-ness is a range rather than a binary. There is legal precedent for this, I think.)

writing...
you cant make such a big decision based on this passion. you need to reconsider...
no. I mean, yes, if I think about this tomorrow, if I wait until tomorrow, I'll change my mind. But that's because all day, every day, I live under clouds. I can't see anything. right now, the sun is shining, and I can see clearly. But it's not going to last long, so do I have to act on it.... What about you?
no, it's not like that for me. My passions are... unreliable. My decisions are only good on the conglomerate. I never have a good idea except by thinking of it once, and twice, and three times, and refining it each time.

tallest person in the room, only Christian in the room, youngest person in the room... I naively thought of all these things as intrinsic to me... and most people won't be the tallest in the room, sure, but everyone's the youngest, and then they're not. some day I'll be the oldest person in any room I'm in. doesn't make me sad, but it doesn't make me precisely happy, either.

When, in fiction, a believable (even easy) explanation for something exists, but is not given by the narrative... I think that this is delinquent, but people may argue that, if I as the viewer can figure it out, what's wrong with not having it? They may even suggest that this is a positive in my system of critique, as it relies more on something occurring in the viewer's head than on the page/screen. But the problem is twofold: first, that the thing occurring in our own head is more likely to go in a mundane, adding-no-details direction, if we are given enough leeway (that is, lack of detail) to choose one of several options, rather than being guided carefully into the correct one (must compare with the noodle incident!). Second, though perhaps this is really the same problem, lacking any information that makes plot event X possible, we proceed with the assumption that it is not; consequently, though we may easily be able to come up with plausible reasons that allow X to happen, what occurs in our brain naturally is the thought that it is not possible, and so X is a contradiction. At worst, this simply breaks the illusion of disbelief that makes even mediocre fiction possible. At  best, it still breaks the feeling of inevitability that makes possible (or at least greatly facilitates) great fiction.,

unrelated: I find it troubling how often people so fully all agree with each other within different political sides. I mean, it just seems so artificial that such a large group of people would agree with each other on Ferguson and climate change and abortion and death penalty and breast feeding and gay marriage and nude laws and and and... I mean, there are multiple political things here I disagree with my own wife.





Agreed. I dislike the idea that unaffiliated people, reliant entirely on the internet, are able to somehow investigate such a case more thoroughly -- and interpret the law more accurately -- than the officials and professionals who are trained and required to do so, and who have greater access to the available evidence than anyone else.
That said, as a citizens of a democracy, I think it is reasonable (and arguably required) for us to judge our elected officials according to the actions they take within the capacities of their positions, and to enforce our judgements using any reasonable, legal means available to us (which include not only ordered proceedings, such as voting, but unordered proceedings, such as public discourse).
In this particular case, I'm not in favor of trying to play judge for Brown or Wilson, but I think it's more than reasonable to be publicly critical of the elected officials involved in the case. For instance, my research (such as it's been) leads me to be skeptical of the Prosecuting Attorney, Robert McCulloch, who's actions in the trial have been called "unusual", even by his own spokesperson.

How to find the "area" of the sky
From [[XKCD what if?|https://what-if.xkcd.com/109/]].

The area of a sphere is 4πr2. Ok, great, but what's the "radius" of the sky? Well, if the sky is a sphere around us, the radius is "one radian", because that's the radius of anything. But a radian is also 57.3 degrees, which means the sky is 57.3 degrees "away" from us. 4 times pi times 57.3 = 41,253 square degrees.

"Silence is violence"
children-in-africa argument...

Serious question:
If a person's word is all it takes for them to be male/female, what about age, race, height, etc?

If response is, "gender is a social construct", then say, I'm referring to chromosomes.
    Or, more nuanced; ask whether there's any real difference between drawing a dividing line between "biological/chromosomal sex" and identified gender, and "biological age" and identified age, etc.


Might be a waste of time though...






Everyone's duty. Why is it everyone's duty to <abolish discrimination, hate, etc.>, but not to <feed the hungry, build infastructure, etc., up to persuing transhumanism>?

Rights. Why is healthcare a right, as well as safety and voting and such, but not food, job, house, entertainment?

Minimum wage... the issue is framed poorly when you ask, wouldn't you want people to have enough to survive? Of course we do! It's like saying, the only acceptable teacher-student ratio is 1.







"The business of government at all levels is to patch up and preserve a non-ideal reality, and were its task to be compared with that of the modern hospital, then it might more properly be likened to the casualty department than to that of plastic surgery.That is to say, as a preservative of the fallen Creation secular authority operates under the law, being only indirectly related to the gospel which, as the life-giving message of the forgiveness of sin for Christ's sake, plants the new Creation in the midst of the old. As it is customarily employed the term 'social gospel' is therefore a theological nonsense. Luther has a parable in On Secular Authority which speaks directly to the enthusiasm of the 'social gospel'. To rule the world with the gospel would, he contends, be like a shepherd putting wolves, lions, eagles and sheep all together in the same fold. In blissful naïveté the shepherd bids these creatures of disparate temperament enjoy their fodder in peace unhindered by the coercion of dogs or clubs. The sheep, surmises the Reformer, will indeed follow the ways of peace, but not for long."

-The Two Governments and the Two Kingdoms in Luther's Thought

by Dr. John R. Stephenson









In relation to the thought experiment reverse racism article...

Suppose it turned out that the earth were one of ten planets that had human life, and on eight of the others, women were as privileged as men are on this planet, and always had been. Would that make current sexism backwards? Would it retroactively make past sexism backwards?

If the answer is "no, because of no contact", suppose we start having contact. A little trading. Is that enough?

If the answer is "no, it must be significant contact", then okay, so, the Earthly racism is the most relevant one only if it's the one having the real effect on the individuals in question, right?

If so, then what about individual men who suffer something serious because of ("reverse") racism against them, in their particular situation, even if overall they live in a male-centric ecosystem?






Physically possible, and determinism...
Are physically possible fictions better than impossible ones? Are fictions which modify the Bible or God inherently worse than those which do not? Should all fiction be considered equally impossible?

Immovable post and unstoppable cannonball... possible for both to exist, provided they don't collide. Question of their collision has no answer. Physically impossible questions either never have answers, or do not necessarily have answers. What about things which could have happened, but didn't? They are in a sense impossible. If the world is deterministic, they never were possible to begin with.

Is the world backwards-deterministic?

No. You shall not murder. You can want something without coveting it, you can get something without stealing it, you can have sex without committing adultery, and you can kill without murdering.... You must face the ultimate test of your ideals.
...but I think its better to start with lesser tests...
No. If you cannot face the ultimate test, then you do not really hold those ideals, and starting with smaller tests is only postponing that revelation.



2014-05-24 waffle experiments

Made five sets of waffles, each with the second variation of the waffle recipe, with the following modifications:

*no flour or protein powder
**Tasted pretty good, though a bit bland. Thin and with a hint of moistness. Pancakey.
*1/4 C white flour, 2 T milk
**Again a good but bland taste. Fluffiest of all the waffles, probably due to having the best tolerance for longer cooking. Sarah's favorite of the bunch.
*1/4 C whole wheat flour, 3 T milk
**Again a good but bland taste. Blandess was that of whole wheat, and therefore marginally less appitizing than the others. A little too dense.
*1/4 C protein powder (whey isolate), 2 T milk
**Way too much protein powder. I also think they "isolate" stuff is stronger than the stuff I usually get. Consequently, these waffles did not taste good. In texture they were almost as flat as A.
*A more or less equal mix of the above.
**The most interesting taste, easily. The texture was probably most similar to D.

How to make good picture pancakes

Thinking about Eleanor Pettus — intimidation — really, from a romantic standpoint (CONTRAST with friendship standpoint), EVERYONE should be intimidating. Any spouse requires nothing less than your entire life.

Thinking about relationships... "all you need is love"... when you avoid defining an emotional relationship (e.g., nightly online chats), it becomes slightly mysterious, and maybe seems... I dunno... beyond criticism.

The spirit is willing, but the flesh is two years old.

Determine best dog food. Pedigree / Purina?

Is this correct?: If you move the camera enough, skew the scales enough, you can put any data into any (relative) shape.

Nat's anti-razor. It's not so simple. Set A is all things that can be delineated in the way discussed; a subset is those for which this is accurate; a further subset — and this is key, because we're talking about humans and actuality (which cannot be encompassed with words) — is those for which this delineation is also helpful (e.g., efficient use of resources (?)). [???]

The ability to respond properly to extreme & unusual situations, without panicking, without romanticizing things, without a perverse desire for tragedy, belongs to ... the well-ordered mind? The person of principles?

Game metrics: Idiot test: Could a perfect but ignorant player win on the first try? If not, how close could they get? How many attempts would it take?



Every reveal should make previous events make more sense (seem more inevitable), rather than less.
What occurs in the reader's mind is more compelling than what occurs on the page.
The tether... don't lose the final point of contact with quality, meaning, concreteness, literalness, etc.
The intersection of plot, character, aesthetic, and metaphor... two or more is stronger (just like in physics).
The imposition of will... maybe I need to break these rules into "simple" and "complex", or "guidelines" and "structures/observations".
If the reader obsesses over ways that a tragedy (fictional) could have been averted, it's a quality tragedy.

Notes while watching Ender's Game:
—Lack of subtlety, restraint.
—Throw away opportunity to improve what is wrong with novel.
—Often just plain misses the heart.
—Like trailers... all dials always at 10. No variation in conveyence of information. Don't necessarily NEED crazy scenes (silence, blindness, Solyaris, 2001), but just variation in INTENSITY.
—Ender consolidates events, making the portrayed things illogical, instead of showing us quintessential events and informing us about the background info.
—This stuff is more important in a concept-book like Ender.
—Conveyence also because often the mood is just wrong, or probes only very shallowly the depth of variation of possible... emotion or whatever.
—So much of Ender is based on what is unknown. That has to be held sacred in form, even if the audience guesses/knows. ... The good joke remains funny!
—Pro chars talk like pop sci instead of sci.
—Ender film succeeds in visual representation of battle school and, especially, final battle, number of ships, conveys weight of loss...
—Conveyence also best tool if you want to differentiate between minds of two chars, or one char & visual narration.
—Lit has unique ways of conveying information. Film, others... Shame when film resorts to simplest of infodumps.
—Graff more logical and compassionate in book. Makes war crime, guilt, more meaningful.
—That's not how ants work.
—Simplicity of conveyence reduces what occurs in audience's mind.
—Even quiet scenes blare the Quiet Scene Music.
—As Syme says, most powerful fact in oratory. Also powerful fact in ... all media. Certainly a, say, murder, is more powerful/compelling if it's the only one in a film.

Sophisticomics: good to have a face, mascot (Hark has the very distinctive style, Kate herself, and Napoleon; XKCD's figures are actually quite recognizable). Use a mildly Colbertish persona; the associative and psychic distance will reduce the likelihood of fallout.
Custoo Fintel. Sophisticomics. But no actual elitism or cynicism. Fintel must inhabit a world suitably different from our own.

Add finger independence to stretching (maybe?).

Need a character who perposely and purposefully removes self from area of temptation ["near occasion of sin"]. Specifically, the temptation towards cynicism. Yes, you may be obliged to your position, but if you are not...
—Suppose you work with the homeless. And you find you are beginning to despise the homeless. So you work somewhere else, and let your opinion of the homeless, logically dispositioned (the despisal was emotional in nature, yet difficult/impossible to resist), equalize. Imply that not doing so, when you have the opportunity, is irresponsible.
—Connect with idea that merely seeing someone with, say, a subordinate, is not to get a full measure of their character. All people are flawed. Perhaps this person is flawed in that they are a poor leader; or that they do not self-regulate their flaws well.
—This all connects to the anti-razor.

Extraordinary claims do not require extraordinary proofs. Extraordinary claims require the same kind of proof that every other claim requires: sufficient.

"Have you come here to inquire / What it is that we conspire?"

—Oh, hell. Do I have to answer him in rhyme, too?
—No, he doesn't understand it when you tell HIM a rhyme.
—...explanation...
—He doesn't understand normal speech, either.

Things and words really do get less useful after a while.

True Opinions About Audiobooks
1. If a single word of the text is omitted, then the audiobook should be labelled "abridged".
2. The only time a word should be spoken during the reading that is not part of the original text, is to explain something important that would otherwise be lost in the translation from text to audio. For instance, purposeful misspellings, like in "Flowers for Algernon".
3. Music and sound effects should only be used before or after the text of the book. Otherwise, it should be labelled an "adaptation" or similar. Shout-out to "Bridge to Terabithia", which had the greatest tonal dissonance between music and story I've heard yet.
4. Generally, I think there should not be more than one voice actor per work, again not including intro and outro material. Shout-out to "Shadow of the Hegemon", which several times switched voice actor mid-sentence.
5. Songs that appear without obvious melodies should probably be spoken, not sung.
6. Some leeway for actually coughing/laughing/yelling when that is what is in the dialogue, so long as you are neither omitted any word written, nor enunciating any word not written.
for instance, if you're trying to do an audiobook of something that's full of footnotes, or illustrations, or "House of Leaves", you should

* scratch 4 Arrival

I like that it's slow, and soft
I like that it lets the viewer figure some things - not everything, but some things - out for themself
I like that it has a real idea, or real ideas within it
I like that it's sad, or melancholy
I like that Amy Adams isn't made up to be breathtakingly gorgeous in every shot (relatively, I mean)
I like that it doesn't have a very explosive ending

It was shot similarly to The Tree of Life, if you took out most of the dialogue and plot and aliens.

negatives
- biggest negative is the dialogue, which I found to be pretty hit-or-miss. It was best when it was realistic and straightforward, but there were a lot of melodramatic nuggets that felt out of place to me. It reminded me of Interstellar, which is a tragic movie in my mind, because a lot of the content of that movie, at least half, is really, really good - to where I think it could legimitely be compared with 2001: A Space Odyssey. But the movie is weighed down by an enormous dose of melodrama that is just... so disappointing.

This issue of... liking a movie on principle, liking what a movie is trying to be, what it represents, what it tries (though maybe entirely fails) to offer that is not even being attempted at offered by anything else...

* scratch 5 transcript letter to academic advisor

2. would like to use math, but can't because of C- major
5. nontraditional student, late CLEP okay

realize it's been a year - apologize - I've been meaning to send this email to you for over a year now, but I've been busy, and it's a very hard subject for me to think about.



Mr. Ryan,

It's been over a year since I last emailed you (that email was about PLA credits). This is partially due to life circumstances which took my attention away from my studies, and partially due to a general difficulty I have with approaching this subject. In any case, I apologize for any inconvenience my delay causes you.

I would like to finish my Interdisciplinary Studies B.A., if possible. As far as I can tell, I can do this with my current credits, the two PLAs we discussed, and four additional CLEPs. I have attached a spreadsheet supporting this, so you can tell me if I've misunderstood anything.

A few notes on my spreadsheet:

1. The CLEPs and PLAs which I have not yet acquired are highlighted in red.

2. Classes which I passed with a C- or lower I have highlighted in orange. According to Bethel's Academic Policies & Procedures, these cannot count towards my major.

3. Although the Bethel Academic Catalog lists KINE 105 (Wellness - 1 hour) as a requirement, I was told that I could substitute a combination of PHED 100 (Lifelong Physical Awareness - 0.5 hours) and another PHED (such as 112 Volleyball - 0.5 hours). I have not been able to confirm this.

4. I am assuming that I am still eligible for the PLA credits. If I am not, I will have to make up some or all of those 7 hours with classes/CLEPS.

5. The Academic Policies & Procedures state that "Traditional students may not obtain credit by CLEP examinations within [the] last 30 hours [of their degree]." My understanding is that, as an adult student, I am not a "traditional" student, and so this prohibition does not apply to me. I have not actually confirmed this, although I probably should have.

Thank you very much,

Computer crashing several times a day for ~4 years. Running out of things to replace.

So my desktop restarts about 2 times a day (varies greatly) since I first built it about 4 years ago. At first, these crashes took the form of a blue screen with the error message "WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR". After a while, I stopped getting these crashes, and instead it would freeze on whatever the current frame was, and a buzzing sound would come from the speakers/headphones. After a while, it changed again, and now when it crashes it just instantly restarts, as though I'd hit the restart button on the case.

I have found no way of consistently triggering these crashes. They happen more frequently when I'm gaming, but they can also happen during web browsing, wathing a video, or literally sitting on the desktop.

What I've tried so far:

- new installation of Windows on new harddrive, old harddrives disconnected
- replaced and upgraded RAM
- SpeedFan to see if something was overheating (it wasn't)
- added 3 case fans
- removed GPU, disk drive, and all peripherals except mouse, keyboard, headphones, and USB modem
- replaced mouse, keyboard, headphones, and USB modem
- dissassembled computer, visually inspected for damage, dusted with compressed air, re-applied thermal paste to CPU
- replaced all SATA cords

Other diagnostic tools I've used:

- BlueScreenView (no results)
- Windows Event Viewer (just says "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first.")
- HeavyLoad (unable to induce crash)

Literally the only parts of the desktop that I have not replaced are:

- motherboard: ASRock H81M-HDS
- CPU: i5-4670K
- PSU: ModXStream Pro Series 600
- case: NZXT Source 210 Elite + 1 original case fan

My instinct is that it's either the mobo or CPU, but my funds are limited and I'm reluctant to switch one out without being somewhat certain that it's the culprit. Is there any software that can test them for problems?

* next Bethel letter

Thanks, Ron. Two more questions:

1. Is it possible to change my Secondary Concentrations to LIT and HIST? If so, then I will have already completed the requisite 18 hours of my concentration at Bethel, and can finish with just CLEPs and PLAs.

2. You said I should avoid missing a school year without any activity. Do CLEPs or PLAs count as "activity", or do they have to be classes? What should I consider my cut-off date for missing a full year?

Thanks again,

* fortnite weapons

Namely, the "worst weapon" niche. As in, the weapon you only use if you don't have anything else. None of them are as good as a shotgun for close range, or an AR for medium range. I think there might be some very particular range or circumstance where the SMG is technically better than the shogtun/AR, but it's so rare that nobody I see (certainly not the pros) ever feel the need to make room for an SMG in their inventory.

Not only is shotgun+AR the optimal base setup, but you're almost guaranteed to have it if you survive the first 2-3 minutes of the game, because at that point you've either looted several houses or won several fights.

Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with having a "worst weapon". In fact, I think it improves the game. But it seems unnecessary to have three.

I think the game would have more depth if two of the three were improved to the point where they were actually viable choices in the mid-game. I don't want them to replace the shotgun and AR as best in their classes, but there are other ways to give them unique advantages. Some of them even seem half-implemented. For instance, the revolver feels like it should be used as a semi-sniper, with its high damage and slow firing speed. But of course, the random bloom makes this a joke. Maybe when the shooting model changes, this could change? Imagine if crouching with the revolver gave it perfect first-shot accuracy, but it had the same bullet speed and drop as the sniper. Or, to go in the opposite direction, imagine if you could fan the trigger and empty the clip in half a second, so that the revolver could act as a shotgun counter, if you 

Likewise, I wonder if there's a way to make the suppressed SMG more usable in a stealthy way.

But it's so much more important to actually, you know, **win** those close-combat encounters that, again, I really don't see anyone taking an SMG when a shotgun is available.

* fortnite tips

going straight down at first is faster
looking straight forward with glider is faster
can move ~one gride square in parachute
deploying over water probably not worth it

avoid doorway standoffs and initial chest battles
if tying for a house, go in the front door; maybe fight if you have a shotgun or whatever

pump>all other short range

panic build with wood
build up with brick/metal
build 3 stories high
leave trees/rocks with 50 health

build one way, go another
build a lot, try to confuse them

SMGs are great for destroying walls

ghost peek over brick walls

I think all cracks can be shot through, except crachs in player-made structures (like gaps in brick walls). These block shots.

run from losing battles

look for opportunities to sneak: build with like materials, make use of explosion sounds and sirens

line up your shots

should almost always use health stuff as soon as you can

to descend anything quickly, use floor-landing; don't build stairs down

WEAPONS
don't use tac SMG; don't use suppressed SMG unless you NEED silenced and don't have a suppressed pistol
the suppressed SMG is a worse SMG that's, well, suppressed. It should only be used if you really want a suppressed weapon and can't find a suppressed pistol.
Tactical SMGs are worse SMGs and worse ARs and should never be used if you can help it.

(Luckily, the challenge does not stipulate *consecutive* days.)

The Horners originally introduced me to Jimmie Rodgers, although I suspected that their fondness for this album was partially for ironic or novelty value, as it's distinctly corny. Anna, you can correct me if this is correct, or base slander. Anyway, I thought I also was enjoying the album ironically, until I realized I was just enjoying it the regular way.

I would describe Jimmie Rodgers' style as "love songs your grandpa sings to embarass your grandma".

Favorite track: Tucumcari

* Pre-flight checklist

PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST 
1. First-time pilots and co-pilots should check that all their paperwork is in order.
2. Clearly indicate emergency exits.
3. Ensure all personal protective equipment is easily accessible.
4. Secure jewelry and other loose articles.
5. Remove all objects obstructing flight path.
6. Adjust cockpit lighting to a comfortable level.
7. Pilot and co-pilot should perform visual inspections of each other.
8. Taxi to runway.

DURING FLIGHT 
NOTE: Regulation uniforms are not required after this point.
1. Maintain clear communication between pilot and co-pilot at all times. 
2. Take off slowly and carefully.
3. Check oil levels regularly. Low oil may cause damage to sensitive components.
4. Make sure engine is warmed up before reaching maximum speed.
5. Adjust thrust and angle of attack as necessary.
6. Ensure landing gear is fully deployed before landing.

WARNING: Unexpected rough air may be encountered. This is normal, and not a cause for alarm.

;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.

I only know as much as I've been able to research in the past hour, so I'm not super confident in my opinion one way or another, but here are the points and questions that strike me as important.

- Section 230 "makes online services immune from civil liability for the actions of their users" (Wikipedia).

- The proposed legislation (SESTA) would change Section 230 "to exclude enforcement of federal or state sex trafficking laws from its immunity" (Wikipedia).

- EFF says that the "federal criminal sex trafficking statute" (18 U.S.C. § 1591) can be used "to go after websites that host ads knowing that such ads involve sex trafficking". However, it's not clear to me whether this has had a positive effect against backpage.com, and if not, why not.

- The "adult" section of the US version of backpage.com was shut down in January of this year. It's unclear to me what effect this had on the sex trafficking.

- I have not been able to find nearly as many accusations of sex trafficking against craigslist, despite it being larger than backpage.com and functionally similar.

- Opponents of SESTA say that 1. it's fundamentally unfair to hold website owners responsible for the actions of their sites' users, and 2. the bill would jeopardize the existence of any website or service that allows user-made content, except perhaps those wealthy enough to hire lawyers to protect themselves. I am sympthatic to both of these arguments.

Hard to find anything to say without feeling unduly sorry for myself.

When I get my 40-50 hour job, I still will not be the breadwinner as defined by His Needs, Her Needs, nor will I be until I can make at least ~$17 /hr.

No reason to expect I will be better at getting other stuff done when I have a job. Weekdays with kids: watch them from 8-6 (10 hours), with the possibility of 1-2 hours of reprieve, depending on the day. Weekday job: 7:30-5:00 (assuming half an hour commute time) (9.5 hours). In the first cat, I then have two days with you that are semi-free. In the second cat, those two days are childcare days.

My executive function is self-evidently terrible. I'm only just now figuring out how to wake up when I want to, and get my schoolwork done on time (barely).

Many of my feelings are just feeling sorry for myself, or suffering that I have no right to complain about and therefore won't.
















Ignoring interest compounding, borrowing at 20 percent per year would lead to doubling in five years; someone who knew about interest on interest might have selected a number less than five. Someone who knows the 'rule of 72' heuristic would know that it would be about 3.6 years, which makes the correct answer "2 to 4 years." In finance, the rule of 72 is a method for estimating an investment's doubling time. The rule number (i.e., 72) is divided by the interest percentage per period to obtain the approximate number of periods (usually years) required for doubling. The other responses reflect a misunderstanding of the concept of interest accrual.

Misc Ireland notes...

Last year I bought some linen from the local fabric shop. I cut it into three pieces for a face cloth, small hand towel, and large bath towel. The total dimensions prior to cutting was aprox. 54 inches square. I used the golden ratio when I cut. (basically cut 1/3 off the large piece. Then did the same again to the small piece). Then took the pieces to a local tailor who serged the edges for around $10.

many people become enamored of writing or the writing life... when they come to understand what it actually take a to write, whether they continue will depend on whether the thing they became enamored of was what they thought writing was like, or having written... and if the latter, if they like it enough to do what it turns out you have to do to produce quality writing.

It's easier to accept and even like a rhythm, a daily or weekly schedule, when you're older, because those lengths of time are more meaningful. I mean... when you're older, time dilates a bit, and it's possible to actually perceive, say, the progress made in practicing the guitar 5 days a week for 30 minutes, whereas it's difficult to perceive this from the more limited viewpoint of a child. So the adult is, in a sense, not more mature, because they're ALSO doing it just for the pleasure... it's just that their time-frame puts the gratification closer (relatively) to the action, and so makes it more gratifying.

A while ago, I told anyone I could get ahold of that if Trump somehow won the candidacy, he'd be handing the presidency to whoever the Democratic nominee was. I said this based on my intuition. But I also said that Trump's chances of winning the candidacy were extremely low, and I based this not on my intuition, but on the available probabilistic data. Since this latter has proven so 
...

I am on record as saying that if Trump won the nomination, he'd be handing the presidency to the Democrats. Now I'm not so sure. The polls, and common sense, suggest that he can't possibly beat either Clinton or Sanders... but polls and common sense were what said he couldn't possibly become the nominee. Now, that may have had something to do with the unusual dynamics of the Republican race, but I keep thinking that there's something bigger and subtler at play, something that doesn't show up on the usual tests because Trump's behavior falls outside of their calibration.

The popular passtime is to analyze Trump and his supporters; to figure out just what went wrong. Opinions are divided on whether Trump is a genius or an idiot, and wh

People are divided as to whether Trump's success is due to him being a genius who understands more than anyone else how to get votes (which is why so many people were surprised when he got them), or due to him being a moron, and 








From a purely rational standpoint, I do have some sort of inuitive feeling that life is good (and that a complex life is better than being hooked up to a Permanent Pleasure Machine—but that may be a different subject), and so am not necessarily incline to debate the issue. However, this is very similar to my intuitive sense that consciousness exists, and that I have, or rather am, one, and that it is the important part of me, and neither material nor pattern.

Torture-mote thing... Just assume that the mote thing is the smallest thing which, when summed with all its ripple effects, does not round down to zero. And if you're concerned that the number of mote-victims isn't high enough (you shouldn't be), rephrase the question to be "is there any number of mote-victims which tip the scales towards preferring torture?"



the selfish immortal...
There was an ancient and glorious civilization; universe-spanning; strictly utilitarian; incredibly long-lived, but mortal. They discover the secret to immortality, immortality to such an extent that may or may not be actually infinite, but absolutely survives the death of this an other universes; but for mysterious reasons, they also disocver—and confirm to an absolute fact—that the process for granting this immortality can only ever be used on one individual, ever, and that doing so will cause painful death for every other member of the civilization (and, perhaps, the entire universe). Then suppose that one selfish individual in this civilization, the worst of them by any measure of goodness, mercy, or even altruism (but perhaps the best in cunning) sabotages the mechanism for this immortality so that it can only ever work on him. So the civilization, being strictly utilitarian, immediately throws the switch—after all, an infinity (or arbitrarily large) amount of life for this (admittedly evil) individual is strictly better than any finite amount of life for everyone else, and to delay for even a single second includes the infinitesimal but real chance that this individual will die or the machinery will break down or whatever. Better idea: rather than "sabotaging" the machinery, the evil-doer murders the good and carefully-selected individual and takes his place just before the mechanism is to activate. Well, that makes a slightly better story, but perhaps a slightly worse thought experiment...

Although I was already familiar with all of the concepts covered in the "Problem Solving" section of our textbook, it was helpful to go over them again in a brief but comprehensive way. I tend to understand these things in a conceptual and intuitive way, which lets me muddle through most problems I come across, but usually very slowly and with frequent errors. In particular, I'm glad that the book went over dimensional analysis, because in deciphering the book's solutions, I was re-familiarized with the standard (and almost certainly most efficient) formulas for solving these problems.

The particular formulas that I'm thinking of are these:

A/B = ?/C = CA/B
A/B = C/? = CB/A








The Living Dictionary
The Living Dictionary was a probably too-ambitious project to make the largest and most dynamic dictionary in the world. It actively and in real-time scanned publications, internet posts, TV dialogue, and even what incidental human speech that it could. Instead of having two categories (included and disincluded) or three (included, disincluded, and included with some qualifier e.g. "uncommon"), it had a smooth range from the "most included" (words which anyone would recognize as an active part of English) to "least included", words which were only just then spoken or made up or used from other languages. As a software dictionary, you set a sliding scale to determine how much "inclusion" you wanted to include. The strictest level would only include those words which you would find, unqualified, in a standard, small dictionary; the broadest level would be changing by the second, and its (admittedly unattainable) goal was to include every word spoken or written by anyone. This would include every foreign word spoken in a mostly-English conversation, as a potential loanword. Since it would be too much data to be organized entirely or even mostly by humans, the primary engine was an AI, which consulted human collaborators on key words or sentences or concepts which it had difficulty parsing. The AI also included an understanding of probability sufficient to extrapolate reasonably from its known data into the unknown.

Some dialogue...
A Great for settling arguments.
B I've always thought that people who use dictionaries to settle/support their arguments are stupid.
A You're forgetting that every argument you've ever made has started by consulting a dictionary: the one in your head.
A2 Also, what if the argument is, "Is this word in the dictionary?" or "What's the most commonly accepted academic definition of this word?"


Second-order useless things: learning how to play eg Scrabble very well is a first-order useless thing; learning the spelling (but nothing else about) every English word, or especially every French word, is a useless thing for the purpose of a useless thing, making it a second-order useless thing (although, interestingly, if you learned strong mnemonics in order to learn all those words, that would itself be a useful thing, since mnemonics are undoubtedly more useful than either of the other two things)


Consulting artisans... a secret society (whether SCP or X-Men or whatever) would likely do well to hit up artisans, custom makers, for much of their equipment... assuming they had the money to do so... because their talents and resources would not tend towards product development, and product development is very difficult and costly. There might be some exceptions for technology that the organization had exclusive access to (alien tech, for instance), but they still would be unlikely to be able to get it into a really impressive form-factor; it'll look more like experiments from someone's basement. For the really hard stuff, like iPhone-type electronics miniaturization and user-friendliness, they would rely on custom-makers / artisans.

Come to think of it, this is exactly how Nolan wrote his Batman film: the suit and car were military, the tech was scavenged from a tech company, etc. It wasn't exactly realistic, but still.

In the superlative sense, is it possible to, for instance, train yourself to look at a simple English word and NOT read it? I want to say probably not, but remember that there ARE times when this happens, especially when we are very tired or sick or distracted... is it in any way plausible (or even meaningful) to suggest bringing about the same type of mindset purposefully? Regularly?

The type of puzzle where (for instance) you have to read a word rather than saying the color that it is, or vice versa... is there a genral form, or category? Can I practise it?

    Or, simulated to whatever level of detail necessary: individual neurons, individual molecules, etc. Simulate some physical laws, or all.
What would happen?
    The resultant THING would behave more or less the same as the human from which it was created.
    The resultant THING would not behave at all like the human from which it was created; it might not "behave" in any way at all. Why?

Kahneman refers to an article in the Atlantic, talking about the near universality of religious beliefs, refers to two separate beliefs (majorly paraphrased): 1. That our actions are guided by nonmaterial spirits which 2. Leave our bodies on death. My thought is that with only the slightest changes, these sentences apply to the non-nihilist materialist: specifically #2: if they believe that there is any more worth to a human than, say, a rock, or dumb computer; in short, if they assign any value whatever to life, sentience, intelligence, etc., then they ARE attributing something nonphysical to the human being, although they would say that it is something which derives entirely FROM the physical; probably the word "pattern" is what would be used.

More Kahneman, the "answering the easier question". Says something like, you're asked if Mark will be a good president, and the question you answer instead is, Do I have positive emotions associated with Mark? I think that this is a worst construction. Also possible confusing correlation with causation. For instance, if I have learned that Mark has a history of violence, I will probably both dislike him, and have legitimate reticence to have him be president. Crude example, but.

I figure you're a victim whenever something happens to you which you did not want to happen and did not fully, freely, and with reasonable knowledge cause to happen. So, you can be a "victim" of a bad President's unfair policies, and you can be a "victim" of a hurricane.

(Granted that this can get philosophically messy if we start talking about free will and self-control, etc., but I don't think that's an issue in this discussion.)

(Also, I might go further and suggest that victim-ness is a range rather than a binary. There is legal precedent for this, I think.)

writing...
you cant make such a big decision based on this passion. you need to reconsider...
no. I mean, yes, if I think about this tomorrow, if I wait until tomorrow, I'll change my mind. But that's because all day, every day, I live under clouds. I can't see anything. right now, the sun is shining, and I can see clearly. But it's not going to last long, so do I have to act on it.... What about you?
no, it's not like that for me. My passions are... unreliable. My decisions are only good on the conglomerate. I never have a good idea except by thinking of it once, and twice, and three times, and refining it each time.

tallest person in the room, only Christian in the room, youngest person in the room... I naively thought of all these things as intrinsic to me... and most people won't be the tallest in the room, sure, but everyone's the youngest, and then they're not. some day I'll be the oldest person in any room I'm in. doesn't make me sad, but it doesn't make me precisely happy, either.

When, in fiction, a believable (even easy) explanation for something exists, but is not given by the narrative... I think that this is delinquent, but people may argue that, if I as the viewer can figure it out, what's wrong with not having it? They may even suggest that this is a positive in my system of critique, as it relies more on something occurring in the viewer's head than on the page/screen. But the problem is twofold: first, that the thing occurring in our own head is more likely to go in a mundane, adding-no-details direction, if we are given enough leeway (that is, lack of detail) to choose one of several options, rather than being guided carefully into the correct one (must compare with the noodle incident!). Second, though perhaps this is really the same problem, lacking any information that makes plot event X possible, we proceed with the assumption that it is not; consequently, though we may easily be able to come up with plausible reasons that allow X to happen, what occurs in our brain naturally is the thought that it is not possible, and so X is a contradiction. At worst, this simply breaks the illusion of disbelief that makes even mediocre fiction possible. At  best, it still breaks the feeling of inevitability that makes possible (or at least greatly facilitates) great fiction.,

unrelated: I find it troubling how often people so fully all agree with each other within different political sides. I mean, it just seems so artificial that such a large group of people would agree with each other on Ferguson and climate change and abortion and death penalty and breast feeding and gay marriage and nude laws and and and... I mean, there are multiple political things here I disagree with my own wife.





Agreed. I dislike the idea that unaffiliated people, reliant entirely on the internet, are able to somehow investigate such a case more thoroughly -- and interpret the law more accurately -- than the officials and professionals who are trained and required to do so, and who have greater access to the available evidence than anyone else.
That said, as a citizens of a democracy, I think it is reasonable (and arguably required) for us to judge our elected officials according to the actions they take within the capacities of their positions, and to enforce our judgements using any reasonable, legal means available to us (which include not only ordered proceedings, such as voting, but unordered proceedings, such as public discourse).
In this particular case, I'm not in favor of trying to play judge for Brown or Wilson, but I think it's more than reasonable to be publicly critical of the elected officials involved in the case. For instance, my research (such as it's been) leads me to be skeptical of the Prosecuting Attorney, Robert McCulloch, who's actions in the trial have been called "unusual", even by his own spokesperson.

How to find the "area" of the sky
From [[XKCD what if?|https://what-if.xkcd.com/109/]].

The area of a sphere is 4πr2. Ok, great, but what's the "radius" of the sky? Well, if the sky is a sphere around us, the radius is "one radian", because that's the radius of anything. But a radian is also 57.3 degrees, which means the sky is 57.3 degrees "away" from us. 4 times pi times 57.3 = 41,253 square degrees.

1 Metaphor for choosing life paths. An enormous open caves, where people move through the sides, but can see how much fun people are having on other sides.

2 A place or device or whatever that makes people better, eg healthy, including removing such afflictions and abnormalities as pathological lying.

"Silence is violence"
children-in-africa argument...

Serious question:
If a person's word is all it takes for them to be male/female, what about age, race, height, etc?

If response is, "gender is a social construct", then say, I'm referring to chromosomes.
    Or, more nuanced; ask whether there's any real difference between drawing a dividing line between "biological/chromosomal sex" and identified gender, and "biological age" and identified age, etc.


Might be a waste of time though...






Everyone's duty. Why is it everyone's duty to <abolish discrimination, hate, etc.>, but not to <feed the hungry, build infastructure, etc., up to persuing transhumanism>?

Rights. Why is healthcare a right, as well as safety and voting and such, but not food, job, house, entertainment?

Minimum wage... the issue is framed poorly when you ask, wouldn't you want people to have enough to survive? Of course we do! It's like saying, the only acceptable teacher-student ratio is 1.







"The business of government at all levels is to patch up and preserve a non-ideal reality, and were its task to be compared with that of the modern hospital, then it might more properly be likened to the casualty department than to that of plastic surgery.That is to say, as a preservative of the fallen Creation secular authority operates under the law, being only indirectly related to the gospel which, as the life-giving message of the forgiveness of sin for Christ’s sake, plants the new Creation in the midst of the old. As it is customarily employed the term ‘social gospel’ is therefore a theological nonsense. Luther has a parable in On Secular Authority which speaks directly to the enthusiasm of the ‘social gospel’. To rule the world with the gospel would, he contends, be like a shepherd putting wolves, lions, eagles and sheep all together in the same fold. In blissful naïveté the shepherd bids these creatures of disparate temperament enjoy their fodder in peace unhindered by the coercion of dogs or clubs. The sheep, surmises the Reformer, will indeed follow the ways of peace, but not for long."

-The Two Governments and the Two Kingdoms in Luther’s Thought

by Dr. John R. Stephenson









In relation to the thought experiment reverse racism article...

Suppose it turned out that the earth were one of ten planets that had human life, and on eight of the others, women were as privileged as men are on this planet, and always had been. Would that make current sexism backwards? Would it retroactively make past sexism backwards?

If the answer is "no, because of no contact", suppose we start having contact. A little trading. Is that enough?

If the answer is "no, it must be significant contact", then okay, so, the Earthly racism is the most relevant one only if it's the one having the real effect on the individuals in question, right?

If so, then what about individual men who suffer something serious because of ("reverse") racism against them, in their particular situation, even if overall they live in a male-centric ecosystem?






Physically possible, and determinism...
Are physically possible fictions better than impossible ones? Are fictions which modify the Bible or God inherently worse than those which do not? Should all fiction be considered equally impossible?

Immovable post and unstoppable cannonball... possible for both to exist, provided they don't collide. Question of their collision has no answer. Physically impossible questions either never have answers, or do not necessarily have answers. What about things which could have happened, but didn't? They are in a sense impossible. If the world is deterministic, they never were possible to begin with.

Is the world backwards-deterministic?


Quote
What does the fifth commandment say?
You shall not kill...
No. You shall not murder. You can want something without coveting it, you can get something without stealing it, you can have sex without committing adultery, and you can kill without murdering.... You must face the ultimate test of your ideals.
...but I think its better to start with lesser tests...
No. If you cannot face the ultimate test, then you do not really hold those ideals, and starting with smaller tests is only postponing that revelation.



2014-05-24 waffle experiments

Made five sets of waffles, each with the second variation of the waffle recipe, with the following modifications:

*no flour or protein powder
**Tasted pretty good, though a bit bland. Thin and with a hint of moistness. Pancakey.
*1/4 C white flour, 2 T milk
**Again a good but bland taste. Fluffiest of all the waffles, probably due to having the best tolerance for longer cooking. Sarah's favorite of the bunch.
*1/4 C whole wheat flour, 3 T milk
**Again a good but bland taste. Blandess was that of whole wheat, and therefore marginally less appitizing than the others. A little too dense.
*1/4 C protein powder (whey isolate), 2 T milk
**Way too much protein powder. I also think they "isolate" stuff is stronger than the stuff I usually get. Consequently, these waffles did not taste good. In texture they were almost as flat as A.
*A more or less equal mix of the above.
**The most interesting taste, easily. The texture was probably most similar to D.

How to make good picture pancakes

Thinking about Eleanor Pettus — intimidation — really, from a romantic standpoint (CONTRAST with friendship standpoint), EVERYONE should be intimidating. Any spouse requires nothing less than your entire life.

Thinking about relationships... "all you need is love"... when you avoid defining an emotional relationship (e.g., nightly online chats), it becomes slightly mysterious, and maybe seems... I dunno... beyond criticism.

The spirit is willing, but the flesh is two years old.

Determine best dog food. Pedigree / Purina?

Defense/glorification of nomad lifestyle, maybe intimation as "best" or "only _ _ _"...
Response that it's always X or Y. A or B. Nomad isn't some unique thing at the center of reality, it's one of many options, with its pluses and minuses.

Is this correct?: If you move the camera enough, skew the scales enough, you can put any data into any (relative) shape.

Nat's anti-razor. It's not so simple. Set A is all things that can be delineated in the way discussed; a subset is those for which this is accurate; a further subset — and this is key, because we're talking about humans and actuality (which cannot be encompassed with words) — is those for which this delineation is also helpful (e.g., efficient use of resources (?)). [???]

The ability to respond properly to extreme & unusual situations, without panicking, without romanticizing things, without a perverse desire for tragedy, belongs to ... the well-ordered mind? The person of principles?

Game metrics: Idiot test: Could a perfect but ignorant player win on the first try? If not, how close could they get? How many attempts would it take?



Every reveal should make previous events make more sense (seem more inevitable), rather than less.
What occurs in the reader's mind is more compelling than what occurs on the page.
The tether... don't lose the final point of contact with quality, meaning, concreteness, literalness, etc.
The intersection of plot, character, aesthetic, and metaphor... two or more is stronger (just like in physics).
The imposition of will... maybe I need to break these rules into "simple" and "complex", or "guidelines" and "structures/observations".
If the reader obsesses over ways that a tragedy (fictional) could have been averted, it's a quality tragedy.

Notes while watching Ender's Game:
—Lack of subtlety, restraint.
—Throw away opportunity to improve what is wrong with novel.
—Often just plain misses the heart.
—Like trailers... all dials always at 10. No variation in conveyence of information. Don't necessarily NEED crazy scenes (silence, blindness, Solyaris, 2001), but just variation in INTENSITY.
—Ender consolidates events, making the portrayed things illogical, instead of showing us quintessential events and informing us about the background info.
—This stuff is more important in a concept-book like Ender.
—Conveyence also because often the mood is just wrong, or probes only very shallowly the depth of variation of possible... emotion or whatever.
—So much of Ender is based on what is unknown. That has to be held sacred in form, even if the audience guesses/knows. ... The good joke remains funny!
—Pro chars talk like pop sci instead of sci.
—Ender film succeeds in visual representation of battle school and, especially, final battle, number of ships, conveys weight of loss...
—Conveyence also best tool if you want to differentiate between minds of two chars, or one char & visual narration.
—Lit has unique ways of conveying information. Film, others... Shame when film resorts to simplest of infodumps.
—Graff more logical and compassionate in book. Makes war crime, guilt, more meaningful.
—That's not how ants work.
—Simplicity of conveyence reduces what occurs in audience's mind.
—Even quiet scenes blare the Quiet Scene Music.
—As Syme says, most powerful fact in oratory. Also powerful fact in ... all media. Certainly a, say, murder, is more powerful/compelling if it's the only one in a film.

Sophisticomics: good to have a face, mascot (Hark has the very distinctive style, Kate herself, and Napoleon; XKCD's figures are actually quite recognizable). Use a mildly Colbertish persona; the associative and psychic distance will reduce the likelihood of fallout.
Custoo Fintel. Sophisticomics. But no actual elitism or cynicism. Fintel must inhabit a world suitably different from our own.

Add finger independence to stretching (maybe?).

Need a character who perposely and purposefully removes self from area of temptation ["near occasion of sin"]. Specifically, the temptation towards cynicism. Yes, you may be obliged to your position, but if you are not...
—Suppose you work with the homeless. And you find you are beginning to despise the homeless. So you work somewhere else, and let your opinion of the homeless, logically dispositioned (the despisal was emotional in nature, yet difficult/impossible to resist), equalize. Imply that not doing so, when you have the opportunity, is irresponsible.
—Connect with idea that merely seeing someone with, say, a subordinate, is not to get a full measure of their character. All people are flawed. Perhaps this person is flawed in that they are a poor leader; or that they do not self-regulate their flaws well.
—This all connects to the anti-razor.

Extraordinary claims do not require extraordinary proofs. Extraordinary claims require the same kind of proof that every other claim requires: sufficient.

"Have you come here to inquire / What it is that we conspire?"

—Oh, hell. Do I have to answer him in rhyme, too?
—No, he doesn't understand it when you tell HIM a rhyme.
—...explanation...
—He doesn't understand normal speech, either.

Legislative — makes laws

Things and words really do get less useful after a while. So I think I should focus on the following: it's better for a learned or created thing to be bigger rather than smaller, and, if possible, to be a foundation upon which other things can be built (so even if is original usefulness is gone, it is not wasted)

* data vs anecdotes
Just as there is no upper limit where data becomes perfect, there is no lower limit where data becomes totally imperfect. You can always say something about the reliability of data, and maybe an anecdote really is the best thing if it comes in total, absolute isolation, but can that ever really happen? If anyone says anything about any race, is that ever completely without context? Even if you know nothing about that particular race, even if you've been transported to a different time, you probably are aware that human in general may bad generalizations about racial groups.

* Email to Dr. Jones

Hello, Dr. Jones.

I have some concerns I'd like to talk about with you.

I've mentioned possible migraines in the past, but I haven't been very concerned about them, as I thought they were only causing sensitivity to light and mild headaches. But recently, I've identified a number of other symptoms that are associated with migraines: neck pain, sensitivity to sound, tingling fingers, nausea, pain on one side of my head, weakness, and moodiness. There are certain triggers (especially oversleeping) which seem to exacerbate these symptoms, but I feel like they're present to some extent every day. It's very hard for me to draw the line between migraine symptoms and just being tired/stressed. I've been using an app to track them for several months, and can confidently say that at least 40% of the days I've tracked have been affected.

The only treatments that I've found to consistently work are sleeping or resting in a dark room, and caffeine (which I'm reluctant to take regularly). I've considered the possibility that I just need to get more sleep at night (my average is 6.9 hours), but I'm skeptical about this, because oversleeping is my biggest trigger, and because getting very little sleep doesn't seem to exacerbate my migraine symptoms.

My other concerns have to do with a variety of neurological symptoms. None of these symptoms are serious enough to worry me on their own, and for years I've thought of them as simply personality traits. I've researched a number of conditions (mainly Aspergers and Sensory processing sensitivity), and in my own opinion I don't quite qualify for any of them. Nevertheless, my symptoms are numerous and inconvenient enough that I'd like a professional's opinion. The symptoms are:

- I am very uncomfortable having dirty, greasy, or dry hands. This significantly affects my ability to do manual labor and chores.
- I frequently feel overwhelmed at the amount of detail in my environment. I get a lot of relief from using earplugs or headphones. This is also at least part of the reason why I seek out dark rooms (or simply close my eyes) when I'm stressed.
- After trimming my fingernails, I find it very uncomfortable to touch certain things for 12-24 hours, especially rough/dry things.
- Possible mild dissociative episodes.
- When I'm stressed, I find it comforting to rock back and forth.
- Although I enjoy social interaction, I find it to be pretty draining, especially making consistent eye contact and paying attention to what people are saying.
- I procrastinate frequently and have difficulty focusing my attention on tasks that I want/need to do.

That's about the best I can describe it all. I've also asked Sarah to share her input, since, as my wife, she has more first-hand experience with me than anyone else. What follows are her thoughts.

I've been increasingly concerned about Nathaniel's migraine symptoms and recently learned more about migraine and treatment options which has lead me to wonder if he should have further evaluation. I feel that these symptoms have gotten worse in the last two years and I worry that they are interfering with his functioning normally and/or contributing to cognitive/psychological impairment. He is routinely very intolerant to light (frequently wears a hat indoors to shade his eyes even in what I would consider low light, frequently wears very dark sunglasses even indoors, even went as far as to bring out welding goggles when we went for a walk outside on a sunny day when there was snow on the ground, but I didn't consider the light that glaring or bright. His choice of indoor light level is what I would consider dim light and he can't handle the light above the dining room table being fully on.) Frequently he complains of neck or headache. Around these episodes, he is often either irritable or withdrawn and finds it difficult to focus mentally on anything, which interferes with his occupational and domestic productivity.  

I am also concerned that Nathaniel may be experiencing some sort of psychological disturbance which is affecting his cognitive processing. For example: recently, there have been instances where he received very explicit directions from our couples' counselor which he did not follow through on and when I finally asked him why he didn't do what the counselor told him to do, he seemed genuinely startled and didn't seem to have understood that he was being asked to take action or that he hadn't completed an assignment. This was despite the fact that the counselor had given me a fairly impactful assignment (in Nathaniel's presence) directly in response to the fact that Nathaniel had not followed through. Something is not connecting in his mind that should connect. I don't know if it is depression or something else, but if there is a way to help Nathaniel to be more functional, I think we need to pursue it. 

We're planning to make an appointment in the next week to see you, unless you recommend that we pursue another avenue.

** 539 Christ Is the World's Redeemer
Christ is the world's Redeemer,
The lover of the pure,
The font of heav'nly wisdom,
Our trust and hope secure,
The armor of His soldiers,
The Lord of earth and sky,
Our health while we are living,
Our life when we shall die.

Christ has our host surrounded
With clouds of martyrs bright
Who wave their palms in triumph
And fire us for the fight.
Then Christ the cross ascended
To save a world undone
And, suff'ring for the sinful,
Our full redemption won.

Down through the realm of darkness
He strode in victory,
And at the hour appointed
He rose triumphantly.
And now, to heav'n ascended,
He sits upon the throne
Whence He had ne'er departed,
His Father's and His own.

Glory to God the Father,
The unbegotten One,
All honor be to Jesus,
His sole-begotten Son,
And to the Holy Spirit—
The perfect Trinity.
Let all the worlds give answer:
Amen! So let it be.
** 597 Water, Blood, and Spirit Crying
Water, blood, and Spirit crying,
By their witness testifying
To the One whose death-defying
Life has come, with life for all.

In a wat'ry grave are buried
All our sins that Jesus carried;
Christ, the Ark of Life, has ferried
Us across death's raging flood.

Dark the way, yet Christ precedes us,
Past the scowl of death He leads us;
Spreads a table where He feeds us
With His body and His blood.

Though around us death is seething,
God, His two-edged sword unsheathing,
By His Spirit life is breathing
Through the living, active Word.

Spirit, water, blood entreating,
Working faith and its completing
In the One whose death-defeating
Life has come, with life for all.
** 717 Eternal Father, Strong to Save
Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

O Christ, the Lord of hill and plain,
O'er which our traffic runs amain
By mountain pass or valley low
Wherever, Lord, Thy people go,
Protect them by Thy guarding hand
From ev'ry peril on the land.

O Spirit, whom the Father sent
To spread abroad the firmament;
O Wind of heaven, by Thy might
Save all who dare the eagle's flight
And keep them by Thy watchful care
From ev'ry peril in the air.

O Trinity of love and pow'r,
Our people shield in danger's hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe'er they go;
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
Glad praise from air and land and sea.


O Christ, Whose voice the waters heard
And hushed their raging at Thy word,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep
And calm amid its rage didst sleep:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

Most Holy Spirit, who didst brood
Upon the chaos dark and rude,
And bid its angry tumult cease,
And give, for wild confusion, peace:
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea
** 805 Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow (Doxology)
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all creatures here below;
Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host:
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
Amen. Δ
** 878 Abide With Me
Abide with me, fast falls the eventide.
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.

Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;
Tears for all woes, a heart for ev'ry plea.
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still if Thou abide with me!

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me. 
** 889 Before the Ending of the Day
Before the ending of the day,
Creator of the world, we pray!
Thy grace and peace to us allow
And be our guard and keeper now.

From all the terrors of the night,
From evil dreams defend our sight;
Drive far away our wicked foe
That stain of sin we may not know.

O Father, this we ask be done
Through Jesus Christ, Thine only Son,
Who with the Holy Ghost and Thee
Both lives and reigns eternally. Amen. Δ
