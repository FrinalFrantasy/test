** Sarah's Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake
https://www.bakedbyanintrovert.com/triple-chocolate-mousse-cake/

For the cake

- 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate finely chopped
- 1/4 cup hot water
- 1 teaspoon instant coffee granules
- 2 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter softened
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup buttermilk

For the mousse

- 3/4 teaspoon gelatin powder
- 1 tablespoons water
- 6 ounces semisweet chocolate coarsely chopped
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 and 1/2 cups cold heavy cream

For the ganache

- 3/4 cups heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 9 ounces semisweet chocolate coarsely chopped

Make the cake:

# Adjust the oven rack to the middle of the oven and heat to 350ÂºF. Lightly grease and flour 1 8-inch springform pan. Tap out any excess flour.
# Place the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Bring water to a boil and pour it over the chocolate. Stir with a silicone spatula until the chocolate is melted and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the coffee granules and cocoa powder. Whisk until smooth. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar and stir until thick and glossy, about 2 minutes.
# In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and remaining sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Add the chocolate mixture and mix until thoroughly combined.
# In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir with a whisk. Add half of the flour mixture to the chocolate mixture, followed by the buttermilk, mixing until incorporated. Add remaining flour mixture and mix until the batter is thoroughly combined.
# Spread the batter into the bottom of the prepared pan, smoothing it to the edges with a spatula. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool to room temperature in the pan on a wire rack.

Make the mousse:

# In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over water, let stand for 5 minutes. Place chocolate and sugar in a medium bowl. Bring 1/2 cup of the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. 
# Remove from heat; add the softened gelatin and stir until fully dissolved. Pour the cream over the chocolate and whisk until chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. # The mixture will thicken slightly.
# In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the remaining 1 cup cream at medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, about 30 to 60 seconds.
# Use a whisk to mix in 1/3 of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold the remaining whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until no streaks appear. 
# Spoon the chocolate mousse into the pan over the chocolate cake. Smooth the top with an offset spatula. Return the cake to the refrigerator and chill until set, about 2 hours.

Make the ganache:

# Heat the cream and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat just before it begins to boil. 
# Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Stir until chocolate is melted and smooth. Cool to room temperature. 
# Spread the ganache over the top of the mousse layer and refrigerate until set. About 45 minutes.
# Run a knife along the outer edge of the cake to loosen it from the pan and gently remove from the pan. Serve with whipped cream or fresh berries.

Make ahead tip: The cake will keep for up to 3 days stored in the refrigerator.

The cake can be frozen up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before serving.

NOTES

Very very good and rich. One of Sarah's trademarks.

* entrees
** cauliflower potato soup
*** INGREDIENTS
+ 1 head of cauliflower, floret
+ 2 small red potatoes, chunked
+ 4 cups (1 L) of unsalted chicken stock
+ 6 cloves of garlic, minced
+ 6 slices of bacon, chopped
+ 1 medium onion, diced
+ 1 cup (250 ml) of heavy cream
+ 2 bay leaves
+ 2 stalks of green onions, chopped
+ Optional: 2 tablespoons (30 ml) fish sauce
+ Optional: freshly grated Parmesan cheese for garnish

*** INSTRUCTIONS
1) Crisp the Bacon: Place chopped bacon in your Pressure Cooker and turn heat to medium (Instant Pot: press SautÃ© button). Stir occasionally and allow the bacon bits to crisp (~4 mins). Remove bacon bits from pressure cooker and place on paper towel to absorb the excess fat.
2) SautÃ© the Onion, Garlic, and Green Onions: SautÃ© onions in bacon fat for roughly 1 â€“ 2 minutes until soften. Add in garlic and half of the green onions. Season with a pinch of kosher salt and pepper if you like. SautÃ© until fragrant.
3) Deglaze: Pour ~ â…“ cup (100 ml) unsalted chicken stock. Scrub all the brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Keep the brown bits as they are very flavorful.
4) Pressure Cook the Cauliflower Potato Soup: Add 2 bay leaves, cauliflower, and 2 red potatoes in the pressure cooker. Pour the remaining chicken stock into pressure cooker. Close the lid and cook at High Pressure for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and do a 10 minutes Natural Release. Open the lid carefully.
5) Remove Bay Leaves (Optional): If you don't think your immersion hand blender is powerful enough to blend through the bay leaves, you can remove them at this step.
6) Blend & Season: Blend cauliflower soup into desired consistency with an immersion hand blender. Add 1 cup (250 ml) of heavy cream. Taste the soup and season with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of fish sauce and kosher salt.
7) Serve: Garnish with green onions, crispy bacon bits, and freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Enjoy immediately. I think you will love it ðŸ™‚
*** trial 1
+ yellow potatoes instead of red
+ milk instead of cream
+ moderate amount of melty cheese
- green onions
- fish sauce
- Parmesan

I also mixed in the bacon bits instead of using them as a garnish.

Overall, very tasty, very smooth. Mixing in the bacon was questionable, though.

2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tsp baking powder
1 tbsp powdered sugar
1/2 tsp sea salt
6 tbsp cold butter 
2 tbsp coconut oil
2/3 cup 1% milk (2% would most likely work, but I think whole would be too much fat)
Preheat oven to 325 F.

Put the flour, baking powder, powdered sugar, and 1/2 tsp of salt in the food processor.
Pulse to combine.
Add cold butter a few small pats at a time, and pulse to combine.
Add coconut oil.  Pulse to combine.
Slowly drizzle in the milk as you pulse the food processor. Your dough will form a ball. Now turn on your food processor and let it run for 4 minutes. you dough will be warm when you take it out and thats ok.
Next we are going to roll out out dough. I like to roll mine right out on the silpat that I will cook them on, that way they dont get all distorted if you try to move them.

You want to make sure you roll these out nice and thin, about 1/8 inch is good.
Use a 3 inch round cookie cutter to cut them out.  Remove excess dough. Dock the pilot bread all over with a fork, you can get fancy or just stab them all over like I did. I like stabbing them, its kind of theraputic!

Bake your crackers for 25 minutes and then turn off your stove and crack your oven door and let them stay in the oven until cool. This is what gives you a crispy cracker. If you live in an area with high humidity you may need to dry them out in a dehydrator or a very low oven to get them dryed out.
Your done! Store in a tightly sealed jar and as long as you have fully dryed them out (they will be creispy and snapw hen you break them.) they will store indefinately.

"1 hour at 350? That doesnâ€™t seem like enough to polymerize the oil. If the pan is tacky AT ALL, itâ€™s gotta cook way longer. Iâ€™d do 1 hour if I was oiling it to put away and the seasoning was still good.

Also, I have both cast iron and carbon steel, and the Internet always says to use high temp and flax seed oil. But Iâ€™ve found that high temps make the seasoning brittle. Use any oil you want but use longer cook times and lower heat. The results are way better. Thereâ€™s no smoke and you can do it in a few rounds. Iâ€™ll do 350 for a couple of hours over the course of a few days. Iâ€™ll just keep checking and when the coating is completely smooth with no tack itâ€™s done. Itâ€™s so much easier and lass much longer.

Edit: Iâ€™ve done the traditional methods where you apply incredibly thin coats (wiped it off so itâ€™s almost imperceptible) multiple times in between high heatings. Iâ€™ve done that with every oil people commonly recommend. It took a week to do all the coats, only to be disappointed with black chips. All Iâ€™m saying is lower/longer is another option and it works - glossy black without the smoke."

- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- Dash of ground red pepper
- 6 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 6 light multigrain English muffins, split and toasted

# Divide sausage into 6 equal portions; pat each portion into a 3-inch patty (about 1/4 inch thick). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add patties; cook 2 minutes on each side or until done. Transfer patties to a plate. Reserve drippings in pan.
# Combine milk and next 6 ingredients (through red pepper), stirring with a whisk until smooth. Add mixture to pan; bring to a boil, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Cook 3 minutes or until thick and bubbly. Remove from heat.
# Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add eggs; cook 4 minutes, stirring until curds form.
# Divide eggs evenly over bottom halves of muffins. Top each with 3 tablespoons gravy. Place 1 sausage patty and top half of muffin on each sandwich.
# To freeze: Separately cool sandwiches and gravy to room temperature. Wrap each sandwich in plastic wrap. Place sandwiches in a large heavy-duty zip-top plastic bag; freeze. Fill ice-cube molds with gravy, 3 tablespoons per cube. Freeze until solid; transfer gravy cubes to a large heavy-duty zip-top plastic bag, and return to freezer. Store sandwiches and gravy for up to 3 months.
# To heat: Remove sandwiches from wrapping; wrap each in a paper towel. Microwave at HIGH 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Place gravy cube in a small microwave-safe dish. Cover and microwave at HIGH for 1 minute; stir with a whisk until smooth.
