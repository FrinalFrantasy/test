** Sweet Peace
When long days lay down dying
And Evensong is nigh,
The bell across the valley
Rings out this ancient cry:

"Come, rest from all your labors,
Let Him your burdens bear,
Come hasten 'cross the valley,
And bring Him ev'ry care."

That bell forged by my fathers
Sings out its steady song;
And as it rings I'm making
My joyful way along.

And though I pass through sorrow,
My spirit still soars free;
For in that bell I hear Him -
He speaks sweet peace to me.

** Eternal Father, Strong to Save
LSB 717

1
01 Eternal Father, strong to save,
02 Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
03 Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep
04 Its own appointed limits keep:
05 O hear us when we cry to Thee
06 For those in peril on the sea. \

2
01 O Christ, the Lord of hill and plain,
02 O'er which our traffic runs amain
03 By mountain pass or valley low;
04 Wherever, Lord, Thy people go,
05 Protect them by Thy guarding hand
06 From ev'ry peril on the land. \

3
01 O Spirit, whom the Father sent
02 To spread abroad the firmament;

04 Save all who dare the eagle's flight,
05 And keep them by Thy watchful care
06 From ev'ry peril in the air. \

4

** Abide With Me
LSB 878

1
01 Abide with me, fast falls the eventide.
02 The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.
03 When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
04 Help of the helpless, O abide with me. \

2
01 I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour;
02 What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
03 Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
04 Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me. \

3
01 Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,

04 Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me. \

4
01 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
02 Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
03 Change and decay in all around I see;
04 O Thou who changest not, abide with me. \

5
01 I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;
02 Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness.
03 Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
04 I triumph still if Thou abide with me! \

6
01 Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
02 Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies.
03 Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
04 In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me. \\

** Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing
LSB 686

1
01 Come, Thou Fount of ev'ry blessing,
02 Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
03 Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
04 Call for songs of loudest praise.
05 While the hope of endless glory
06 Fills my heart with joy and love,
07 Teach me ever to adore Thee;
08 May I still Thy goodness prove.

2
01 Here I raise my Ebenezer,
02 Hither by Thy help I've come;
03 And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
04 Safely to arrive at home.
05 Jesus sought me when a stranger,
06 Wand'ring from the fold of God;
07 He, to rescue me from danger,
08 Interposed His precious blood.

3
01 Oh, to grace how great a debtor
02 Daily I'm constrained to be;
03 Let that grace now like a fetter
04 Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee:
05 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
06 Prone to leave the God I love.
07 Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
08 Seal it for Thy courts above.

4
01 Oh, that day when freed from sinning,
02 I shall see Thy lovely face;
03 Clothed then in the blood-washed linen,
04 How I'll sing Thy wondrous grace!
05 Come, my Lord, no longer tarry;
06 Take my ransom'd soul away;
07 Send Thine angels soon to carry
08 Me to realms of endless day.

** Salvation unto Us Has Come
LSB 555

1
01 Salvation unto us has come
02 By God's free grace and favor;
03 Good works cannot avert our doom.
04 They help and save us never.
05 Faith looks to Jesus Christ alone,
06 Who did for all the world atone;
07 He is our one Redeemer. \

2
01 What God did in His Law demand
02 And none to Him could render
03 Caused wrath and woe on ev'ry hand
04 For man, the vile offender.
05 Our flesh has not those pure desires
06 The spirit of the Law requires,
07 And lost is our condition. \

3
01 It was a false, misleading dream
02 That God His Law had given
03 That sinners could themselves redeem
04 And by their works gain heaven.
05 The Law is but a mirror bright
06 To bring the inbred sin to light
07 That lurks within our nature. \

4
01 From sin our flesh could not abstain,
02 Sin held its sway unceasing;
03 The task was useless and in vain,
04 Our guilt was e'er increasing.
05 None can remove sin's poisoned dart
06 Or purify our guileful heart—
07 So deep is our corruption. \

5
01 Yet as the Law must be fulfilled
02 Or we must die despairing,
03 Christ came and has God's anger stilled,
04 Our human nature sharing.
05 He has for us the Law obeyed
06 And thus the Father's vengeance stayed
07 Which over us impended. \

6
01 Since Christ has full atonement made
02 And brought to us salvation,
03 Each Christian therefore may be glad
04 And build on this foundation.
05 Your grace alone, dear Lord, I plead,
06 Your death is now my life indeed,
07 For You have paid my ransom. \

7
01 Let me not doubt, but truly see
02 Your Word cannot be broken;
03 Your call rings out, "Come unto Me!"
04 No falsehood have You spoken.
05 Baptized into Your precious name,
06 My faith cannot be put to shame,
07 And I shall never perish. \

8
01 The Law reveals the guilt of sin
02 And makes us conscience-stricken;
03 But then the Gospel enters in
04 The sinful soul to quicken.
05 Come to the cross, trust Christ, and live;
06 The Law no peace can ever give,
07 No comfort and no blessing. \

9
01 Faith clings to Jesus' cross alone
02 And rests in Him unceasing;
03 And by its fruits true faith is known,
04 With love and hope increasing.
05 For faith alone can justify;
06 Works serve our neighbor and supply
07 The proof that faith is living. \

Δ 10
01 All blessing, honor, thanks, and praise
02 To Father, Son, and Spirit,
03 The God who saved us by His grace;
04 All glory to His merit.
05 O triune God in heav'n above,
06 You have revealed Your saving love;
07 Your blessèd name we hallow. \\
** Christ Is the World's Redeemer
LSB 539

1
01 Christ is the world's Redeemer,
02 The lover of the pure,
03 The font of heav'nly wisdom,
04 Our trust and hope secure,
05 The armor of His soldiers,
06 The Lord of earth and sky,
07 Our health while we are living,
08 Our life when we shall die. \

2
01 Christ has our host surrounded
02 With clouds of martyrs bright,
03 Who wave their palms in triumph
04 And fire us for the fight.
05 Then Christ the cross ascended
06 To save a world undone
07 And, suff'ring for the sinful,
08 Our full redemption won. \

3
01 Down through the realm of darkness
02 He strode in victory,
03 And at the hour appointed
04 He rose triumphantly.
05 And now, to heav'n ascended,
06 He sits upon the throne
07 Whence He had ne'er departed,
08 His Father's and His own. \

Δ 4
01 Glory to God the Father,
02 The unbegotten One,
03 All honor be to Jesus,
04 His sole-begotten Son,
05 And to the Holy Spirit—
06 The perfect Trinity.
07 Let all the worlds give answer:
08 Amen! So let it be. \\

** Who Are You Who Walk in Sorrow
LSB 476

1
01 Who are you who walk in sorrow
02 Down Emmaus' barren road,
03 Hearts distraught and hope defeated,
04 Bent beneath grief's crushing load?
05 Nameless mourners, we will join you,
06 We who also mourn our dead;
07 We have stood by graves unyielding,
08 Eaten death's bare, bitter bread. \

2
01 Who is this who joins our journey,
02 Walking with us stride by stride?
03 Unknown Stranger, can you fathom
04 Depths of grief for one who died?
05 Then the wonder! When we told You
06 How our dreams to dust have turned,
07 Then You opened wide the Scriptures
08 Till our hearts within us burned. \

3
01 Who are You? Our hearts are opened
02 In the breaking of the bread—
03 Christ the victim, now the victor
04 Living, risen from the dead!
05 Great companion on our journey,
06 Still surprise us with Your grace!
07 Make each day a new Emmaus;
08 On our hearts Your image trace! \\
** Before the Ending of the Day
LSB 889

1
01 Before the ending of the day,
02 Creator of the world, we pray!
03 Thy grace and peace to us allow
04 And be our guard and keeper now.

2
01 From all the terrors of the night,
02 From evil dreams defend our sight;
03 Drive far away our wicked foe
04 That stain of sin we may not know.

Δ 3
01 O Father, this we ask be done
02 Through Jesus Christ, Thine only Son,
03 Who with the Holy Ghost and Thee
04 Both lives and reigns eternally. Amen.
** Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow (Doxology)
LSB 805

Δ 1
01 Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
02 Praise Him, all creatures here below;
03 Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host:
04 Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
05 Amen.
** Why Should Cross and Trial Grieve Me
LSB 756

1
01 Why should cross and trial grieve me?
02 Christ is near
03 With His cheer;
04 Never will he leave me.
05 Who can rob me of the heaven
06 That God's Son
07 For me won
08 When His life was given? \

2
01 When life's troubles rise to meet me,
02 Though their weight
03 May be great,
04 They will not defeat me.
05 God, my loving Savior, sends them;
06 He who knows
07 All my woes
08 Knows how best to end them. \

3
01 God gives me my days of gladness,
02 And I will
03 Trust Him still
04 When He sends me sadness.
05 God is good; His love attends me
06 Day by day,
07 Come what may,
08 Guides me and defends me. \

4
01 From God's joy can nothing sever,
02 For I am
03 His dear lamb
04 He, my Shepherd ever.
05 I am His because He gave me
06 His own blood
07 For my good,
08 By His death to save me. \\
** A Mighty Fortress Is Our God
LSB 656

1
01 A mighty fortress is our God,
02 A trusty shield and weapon;
03 He helps us free from ev'ry need
04 That hath us now o'ertaken
05 The old evil foe
06 Now means deadly woe;
07 Deep guile and great might
08 Are his dread arms in fight;
09 On earth is not his equal. \

2
01 With might of ours can naught be done,
02 Soon were our loss effected;
03 But for us fights the valiant One,
04 Whom God Himself elected.
05 Ask ye, Who is this?
06 Jesus Christ it is,
07 Of Sabaoth Lord,
08 And there's none other God;
09 He holds the field forever. \

3
01 Though devils all the world should fill,
02 All eager to devour us,
03 We tremble not, we fear no ill;
04 They shall not overpow'r us.
05 This world's prince may still
06 Scowl fierce as he will,
07 He can harm us none.
08 He's judged; the deed is done;
09 One little word can fell him. \

4
01 The Word they still shall let remain
02 Nor any thanks have for it;
03 He's by our side upon the plain
04 With His good gifts and Spirit.
05 And take they our life,
06 Goods, fame, child, and wife,
07 Though these all be gone,
08 Our vict'ry has been won;
09 The Kingdom ours remaineth. \\
** Water, Blood, and Spirit Crying
LSB 597

1
Water, blood, and Spirit crying,
By their witness testifying
To the One whose death-defying
Life has come, with life for all. \

2
In a wat'ry grave are buried
All our sins that Jesus carried;
Christ, the Ark of Life, has ferried
Us across death's raging flood. \

3
Dark the way, yet Christ precedes us,
Past the scowl of death He leads us;
Spreads a table where He feeds us
With His body and His blood. \

4
Though around us death is seething,
God, His two-edged sword unsheathing,
By His Spirit life is breathing
Through the living, active Word. \

5
Spirit, water, blood entreating,
Working faith and its completing
In the One whose death-defeating
Life has come, with life for all. \\

** Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)
Needs reconsideration. Different versions?

01 If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly the river to the one I love
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

02 Well I had a man, who's long and tall
Who moved his body like a canonball
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

03 I remember one evening, in the pouring rain
And in my heart, was an aching pain
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

04 Muddy rivers, muddy and wild
Can't give a bloody for my unborn child
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

05 So show us a bird flying high above
Life ain't worth living without the one you love
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

** The Witch of the West-Mer-Lands
01 Pale was the wounded knight
That bore the rowan shield,
And cruel were the raven's cries
That feasted on the field,

03 "So course well, my brindled hounds,
And fetch me the mountain hare
Whose coat is as gray as the Wastwater
Or as white as the lily fair."

02 Saying, "Beck water, cold and clear,
Will never clean your wound.
There's none but the Maid of the Winding Mere
Can mak' thee hale and soond."

04 Who said, "Green moss and heather bands
Will never staunch the flood.
There's none but the Witch of the West-mer-lands
Can save thy dear life's blood."

05 "So turn, turn your stallion's head
Till his red mane flies in the wind,
And the rider o' the moon goes by
And the bright star falls behind."

06 And clear was the paley moon
When his shadow passed him by;
Below the hill was the brightest star
When he heard the houlet cry,

07 Saying, "Why do you ride this way
And wharfore cam' you here?"
"I seek the Witch of the West-mer-lands
That dwells by the Winding mere."

08 "Then fly free your good grey hawk
To gather the goldenrod,
And face your horse intae the clouds
Above yon gay green wood."

09 And it's weary by the Ullswater
And the misty brake fern way
Till through the cleft o' the Kirkstane Pass
The winding water lay.

10 He said, "Lie down, my brindled hounds,
And rest, my good grey hawk,
And thee, my steed, may graze thy fill
For I must dismount and walk.

11 "But come when you hear my horn
And answer swift the call,
For I fear ere the sun will rise this morn
You may serve me best of all."

12 And it's down to the water's brim
He's borne the rowan shield,
And the goldenrod he has cast in
To see what the lake might yield.

13 And wet rose she from the lake
And fast and fleet gaed she,
One half the form of a maiden fair
With a jet-black mare's body.

14 And loud, long and shrill he blew,
Till his steed was by his side;
High overhead his grey hawk flew
And swiftly he did ride,

15 Saying, "Course well, my brindled hounds,
And fetch me the jet-black mare!
Stoop and strike, my good grey hawk,
And bring me the maiden fair!"

16 She said, "Pray sheath thy silvery sword,
Lay down thy rowan shield.
For I see by the briny blood that flows
You've been wounded in the field."

17 And she stood in a gown of the velvet blue,
Bound 'round with a silver chain,
She's kissed his pale lips aince and twice
And three times 'round again.

19 She said, "Ride with your brindled hound at heel
And your good grey hawk in hand.
There's nane can harm the knight who's lain
With the Witch of the West-mer-land."

18 She's bound his wounds with the goldenrod,
Full fast in her arms he lay,
And he has risen, hale and sound,
With the sun high in the day.

** If I Can't Have You
If I can't have you, nobody but you-hoo-hoo-hoo
I want to be lonesome, I want to be blue
Wherever I go, whatever I do-hoo-hoo-hoo
I'm all by my ownsome, just thinking of you

I'm missing that sweet embrace, that feeling of bliss
Nobody can take your place when I'm feeling like this
So, if I can't have you, nobody but you-hoo-hoo-hoo
I want to be lonesome, I want to be blue

* poems
** Wake All the Dead
Sir William Davenant


Wake all the dead! what ho! what ho!
How soundly they sleep whose pillows lie low!
They mind not poor lovers who walk above
On the decks of the world in storms of love.
No whisper now nor glance can pass
Through wickets or through panes of glass;
For our windows and doors are shut and barred.
Lie close in the church, and in the churchyard.
In every grave make room, make room!
The world's at an end, and we come, we come.

The state is now love's foe, love's foe;
Has seized on his arms, his quiver and bow;
Has pinioned his wings, and fettered his feet,
Because he made way for lovers to meet.
But, O sad chance, his judge was old;
Hearts cruel grow, when blood grows cold.
No man being young his process would draw.
O heavens, that love should be subject to law!
Lovers go woo the dead, the dead!
Lie two in a grave, and to bed, to bed!
** The Road Not Taken
Robert Frost


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
** The Destruction of Sennacherib
Lord Byron (George Gordon)


   The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

   Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.

   For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!

   And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.

   And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.

   And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord! 
** The Bear Hunt
Abraham Lincoln


A wild-bear chace, didst never see?
      Then hast thou lived in vain.
Thy richest bump of glorious glee,
      Lies desert in thy brain.

When first my father settled here,
      ’Twas then the frontier line:
The panther’s scream, filled night with fear
      And bears preyed on the swine.

But woe for Bruin’s short lived fun,
      When rose the squealing cry;
Now man and horse, with dog and gun,
      For vengeance, at him fly.

A sound of danger strikes his ear;
      He gives the breeze a snuff;
Away he bounds, with little fear,
      And seeks the tangled rough.

On press his foes, and reach the ground,
      Where’s left his half munched meal;
The dogs, in circles, scent around,
      And find his fresh made trail.

With instant cry, away they dash,
      And men as fast pursue;
O’er logs they leap, through water splash,
      And shout the brisk halloo.

Now to elude the eager pack,
      Bear shuns the open ground;
Through matted vines, he shapes his track
      And runs it, round and round.

The tall fleet cur, with deep-mouthed voice,
      Now speeds him, as the wind;
While half-grown pup, and short-legged fice,
      Are yelping far behind.

And fresh recruits are dropping in
      To join the merry corps:
With yelp and yell,—a mingled din—
      The woods are in a roar.

And round, and round the chace now goes,
      The world’s alive with fun;
Nick Carter’s horse, his rider throws,
      And more, Hill drops his gun.

Now sorely pressed, bear glances back,
      And lolls his tired tongue;
When as, to force him from his track,
      An ambush on him sprung.

Across the glade he sweeps for flight,
      And fully is in view.
The dogs, new-fired, by the sight,
      Their cry, and speed, renew.

The foremost ones, now reach his rear,
      He turns, they dash away;
And circling now, the wrathful bear,
      They have him full at bay.

At top of speed, the horse-men come,
      All screaming in a row,
“Whoop! Take him Tiger. Seize him Drum.”
      Bang,—bang—the rifles go.

And furious now, the dogs he tears,
      And crushes in his ire,
Wheels right and left, and upward rears,
      With eyes of burning fire.

But leaden death is at his heart,
      Vain all the strength he plies.
And, spouting blood from every part,
      He reels, and sinks, and dies.

And now a dinsome clamor rose,
      ’Bout who should have his skin;
Who first draws blood, each hunter knows,
      This prize must always win.

But who did this, and how to trace
      What’s true from what’s a lie,
Like lawyers, in a murder case
      They stoutly argufy.

Aforesaid fice, of blustering mood,
      Behind, and quite forgot,
Just now emerging from the wood,
      Arrives upon the spot.

With grinning teeth, and up-turned hair—
      Brim full of spunk and wrath,
He growls, and seizes on dead bear,
      And shakes for life and death.

And swells as if his skin would tear,
      And growls and shakes again;
And swears, as plain as dog can swear,
      That he has won the skin.

Conceited whelp! we laugh at thee—
      Nor mind, that now a few
Of pompous, two-legged dogs there be,
      Conceited quite as you.
** So We'll Go No More a Roving
Lord Byron (George Gordon)


So, we'll go no more a roving
   So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
   And the moon be still as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,
   And the soul wears out the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
   And love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,
   And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a roving
   By the light of the moon. 
** Modern Elfland
G. K. Chesterton


I cut a staff in a churchyard copse,
   I clad myself in ragged things,
I set a feather in my cap
   That fell out of an angel’s wings.

I filled my wallet with white stones,
   I took three foxgloves in my hand,
I slung my shoes across my back,
   And so I went to fairyland.

But lo, within that ancient place
   Science had reared her iron crown,
And the great cloud of steam went up
   That telleth where she takes a town.

But cowled with smoke and starred with lamps,
   That strange land’s light was still its own;
The word that witched the woods and hills
   Spoke in the iron and the stone.

Not Nature’s hand had ever curved
   That mute unearthly porter’s spine.
Like sleeping dragon’s sudden eyes
   The signals leered along the line.

The chimneys thronging crooked or straight
   Were fingers signalling the sky;
The dog that strayed across the street
   Seemed four-legged by monstrosity.

‘In vain,’ I cried, ‘though you too touch
   The new time’s desecrating hand,
Through all the noises of a town
   I hear the heart of fairyland.’

I read the name above a door,
   Then through my spirit pealed and passed:
‘This is the town of thine own home,
   And thou hast looked on it at last.’ 
** Good-bye, and Keep Cold
Robert Frost


This saying good-bye on the edge of the dark
And cold to an orchard so young in the bark
Reminds me of all that can happen to harm
An orchard away at the end of the farm
All winter, cut off by a hill from the house.
I don't want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,
I don't want it dreamily nibbled for browse
By deer, and I don't want it budded by grouse.
(If certain it wouldn't be idle to call
I'd summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall
And warn them away with a stick for a gun.)
I don't want it stirred by the heat of the sun.
(We made it secure against being, I hope,
By setting it out on a northerly slope.)
No orchard's the worse for the wintriest storm;
But one thing about it, it mustn't get warm.
"How often already you've had to be told,
Keep cold, young orchard. Good-bye and keep cold.
Dread fifty above more than fifty below."
I have to be gone for a season or so.
My business awhile is with different trees,
Less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,
And such as is done to their wood with an axe—
Maples and birches and tamaracks.
I wish I could promise to lie in the night
And think of an orchard's arboreal plight
When slowly (and nobody comes with a light)
Its heart sinks lower under the sod.
But something has to be left to God.
** Fire and Ice
Robert Frost


Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.
** And Thou art Dead, as Young and Fair
Lord Byron (George Gordon)


And thou art dead, as young and fair
         As aught of mortal birth;
And form so soft, and charms so rare,
         Too soon return'd to Earth!
Though Earth receiv'd them in her bed,
And o'er the spot the crowd may tread
         In carelessness or mirth,
There is an eye which could not brook
A moment on that grave to look.

I will not ask where thou liest low,
         Nor gaze upon the spot;
There flowers or weeds at will may grow,
         So I behold them not:
It is enough for me to prove
That what I lov'd, and long must love,
         Like common earth can rot;
To me there needs no stone to tell,
'T is Nothing that I lov'd so well.

Yet did I love thee to the last
         As fervently as thou,
Who didst not change through all the past,
         And canst not alter now.
The love where Death has set his seal,
Nor age can chill, nor rival steal,
         Nor falsehood disavow:
And, what were worse, thou canst not see
Or wrong, or change, or fault in me.

The better days of life were ours;
         The worst can be but mine:
The sun that cheers, the storm that lowers,
         Shall never more be thine.
The silence of that dreamless sleep
I envy now too much to weep;
         Nor need I to repine
That all those charms have pass'd away,
I might have watch'd through long decay.

The flower in ripen'd bloom unmatch'd
         Must fall the earliest prey;
Though by no hand untimely snatch'd,
         The leaves must drop away:
And yet it were a greater grief
To watch it withering, leaf by leaf,
         Than see it pluck'd to-day;
Since earthly eye but ill can bear
To trace the change to foul from fair.

I know not if I could have borne
         To see thy beauties fade;
The night that follow'd such a morn
         Had worn a deeper shade:
Thy day without a cloud hath pass'd,
And thou wert lovely to the last,
         Extinguish'd, not decay'd;
As stars that shoot along the sky
Shine brightest as they fall from high.

As once I wept, if I could weep,
         My tears might well be shed,
To think I was not near to keep
         One vigil o'er thy bed;
To gaze, how fondly! on thy face,
To fold thee in a faint embrace,
         Uphold thy drooping head;
And show that love, however vain,
Nor thou nor I can feel again.

Yet how much less it were to gain,
         Though thou hast left me free,
The loveliest things that still remain,
         Than thus remember thee!
The all of thine that cannot die
Through dark and dread Eternity
         Returns again to me,
And more thy buried love endears
Than aught except its living years. 
* prayers
** Apostles' Creed

I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
    maker of heaven and earth.

And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,
    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
    born of the virgin Mary,
    suffered under Pontius Pilate,
    was crucified, died and was buried.
    He descended into hell.
    The third day He rose again from the dead.
    He ascended into heaven
    and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
    From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
    the holy Christian Church,
        the communion of saints,
    the forgiveness of sins,
    the resurrection of the body,
    and the life ☩ everlasting. Amen.
** Nicene Creed

I believe in one God,
    the Father Almighty,
    maker of heaven and earth
        and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
    the only-begotten Son of God,
    begotten of His Father before all worlds,
    God of God, Light of Light,
    very God of very God,
    begotten, not made,
    being of one substance with the Father,
    by whom all things were made;
    who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven
    and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary
    and was made man;
    and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.
    He suffered and was buried.
    And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures
        and ascended into heaven
    and sits at the right hand of the Father.
    And he will come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead,
    whose kingdom will have no end.

And I believe in the Holy Spirit,
    the Lord and giver of life,
    who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
    who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified,
    who spoke by the prophets.
    And I believe in one holy Christian and apostolic Church,
    I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins,
    and I look for the resurrection of the dead
    and the life ☩ of the world to come. Amen.
