* Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)
Needs reconsideration. Different versions?

01 If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly the river to the one I love
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

02 Well I had a man, who's long and tall
Who moved his body like a canonball
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

03 I remember one evening, in the pouring rain
And in my heart, was an aching pain
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

04 Muddy rivers, muddy and wild
Can't give a bloody for my unborn child
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

05 So show us a bird flying high above
Life ain't worth living without the one you love
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.
Oh, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

* Five Hundred Miles
CH If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I have gone
You will hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles,
a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

01 Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two, Lord, I'm three
Lord, I'm four, Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles, five hundred miles
five hundred miles
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home

02 Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go back home this a way
This away, this away, this away, this away
Lord I can't go back home this away

CH
* If I Can't Have You
If I can't have you, nobody but you-hoo-hoo-hoo
I want to be lonesome, I want to be blue
Wherever I go, whatever I do-hoo-hoo-hoo
I'm all by my ownsome, just thinking of you

I'm missing that sweet embrace, that feeling of bliss
Nobody can take your place when I'm feeling like this
So, if I can't have you, nobody but you-hoo-hoo-hoo
I want to be lonesome, I want to be blue
* Hang Me, Oh Hang Me
CH Hang me, oh, hang me; I'll be dead and gone.
Hang me, oh, hang me; I'll be dead and gone.
Wouldn't mind the hangin' but the layin' in the grave so long.
Poor boy, I been all around this world.

01 I been all around Cape Girardeau,* parts of Arkansas.
All around Cape Girardeau, parts of Arkansas.
Got so god-damn hungry I could hide behind a straw.
Poor boy, I been all around this world.

02 Went up on the mountain; there I made my stand.
Went up on the mountain; there I made my stand,
Rifle on my shoulder and a dagger in my hand.
Poor boy, I been all around this world.

CH

03 Put the rope around my neck, hung me up so high.
Put the rope around my neck, hung me up so high.
Last words I heard 'em say: "Won't be long now 'fore you die."
Poor boy, I been all around this world.

* Kelvin Grove
01 Let us haste to Kelvin Grove
Bonnie Lassie-o
Through her mazes let us rove
Bonnie lassie-o
Where the rose in all her pride
Paints the bonnie dingle side
Where the midnight fairies glide
Bonnie lassie-o

02 Though I dare not call thee mine
Bonnie lassie-o
As the smile of fortune's thine
Bonnie lassie-o
Yet with fortune on my side
I could stay thy father's side
Aye, and win thee for my bride
Bonnie lassie-o

03 But the frowns of fortune lour
Bonnie lassie-o
For thy lover at this hour
Bonnie lassie-o
Ere the golden orb of day
Wakes the warblers on the spray
From this land I must away
Bonnie lassie-o

04 Then fareweel to Kelvin Grove
Bonnie lassie-o
And adieu to all thy love
Bonnie lassie-o
Tae the river running clear
Tae the fragrant scentged brier
Even thee, of all most dear
Bonnie lassie-o

05 If upon some foreign shore
Bonnie lassie-o
I should fall midst battle's roar
Bonnie lassie-o
Then, Helen, shouldst thou hear
Of thy lover on his bier
To his memry shed a tear
Bonnie lassie-o

06 But whatever fate decree
Bonnie lassie-o
My heart is aye with thee
Bonnie lassie-o
If the sun from Earth should move
Whether life or death should prove
We shall meet on Kelvin Grove
Bonnie lassie-o

* Sweet Peace
When long days lay down dying
And Evensong is nigh,
The bell across the valley
Rings out this ancient cry:

"Come, rest from all your labors,
Let Him your burdens bear,
Come hasten 'cross the valley,
And bring Him ev'ry care."

That bell forged by my fathers
Sings out its steady song;
And as it rings I'm making
My joyful way along.

And though I pass through sorrow,
My spirit still soars free;
For in that bell I hear Him -
He speaks sweet peace to me.
* The Witch of the West-Mer-Lands
01 Pale was the wounded knight
That bore the rowan shield,
And cruel were the raven's cries
That feasted on the field,

03 "So course well, my brindled hounds,
And fetch me the mountain hare
Whose coat is as gray as the Wastwater
Or as white as the lily fair."

02 Saying, "Beck water, cold and clear,
Will never clean your wound.
There's none but the Maid of the Winding Mere
Can mak' thee hale and soond."

04 Who said, "Green moss and heather bands
Will never staunch the flood.
There's none but the Witch of the West-mer-lands
Can save thy dear life's blood."

05 "So turn, turn your stallion's head
Till his red mane flies in the wind,
And the rider o' the moon goes by
And the bright star falls behind."

06 And clear was the paley moon
When his shadow passed him by;
Below the hill was the brightest star
When he heard the houlet cry,

07 Saying, "Why do you ride this way
And wharfore cam' you here?"
"I seek the Witch of the West-mer-lands
That dwells by the Winding mere."

08 "Then fly free your good grey hawk
To gather the goldenrod,
And face your horse intae the clouds
Above yon gay green wood."

09 And it's weary by the Ullswater
And the misty brake fern way
Till through the cleft o' the Kirkstane Pass
The winding water lay.

10 He said, "Lie down, my brindled hounds,
And rest, my good grey hawk,
And thee, my steed, may graze thy fill
For I must dismount and walk.

11 "But come when you hear my horn
And answer swift the call,
For I fear ere the sun will rise this morn
You may serve me best of all."

12 And it's down to the water's brim
He's borne the rowan shield,
And the goldenrod he has cast in
To see what the lake might yield.

13 And wet rose she from the lake
And fast and fleet gaed she,
One half the form of a maiden fair
With a jet-black mare's body.

14 And loud, long and shrill he blew,
Till his steed was by his side;
High overhead his grey hawk flew
And swiftly he did ride,

15 Saying, "Course well, my brindled hounds,
And fetch me the jet-black mare!
Stoop and strike, my good grey hawk,
And bring me the maiden fair!"

16 She said, "Pray sheath thy silvery sword,
Lay down thy rowan shield.
For I see by the briny blood that flows
You've been wounded in the field."

17 And she stood in a gown of the velvet blue,
Bound 'round with a silver chain,
She's kissed his pale lips aince and twice
And three times 'round again.

19 She said, "Ride with your brindled hound at heel
And your good grey hawk in hand.
There's nane can harm the knight who's lain
With the Witch of the West-mer-land."

18 She's bound his wounds with the goldenrod,
Full fast in her arms he lay,
And he has risen, hale and sound,
With the sun high in the day.
