**** 09:15-10:15 1.00 orientation with Donna Harrison

Mentioned a book called "The Population Bomb".
Certain forces in the world wish to reduce the world population to less than two billion humans.
ACOG, Planned Parenthood, and the Center for Reproductive Rights are key players, and have personnel overlap.
ACOG was instrumental in Roe v Wade and Doe v Bolton.
Doe v Bolton was "the exception that swallos the rule": it allowed Roe v Wade to apply to all pregnancies at all times.
AAPLOG was an offshoot of ACOG in 1973.
The "Hoekstra Coats Amendment" (sp?) was/is a conscience protection amendment.

I was made an administrator of AAPLOG's WildApricot site, and an email was sent to Kevin Pojezny, asking him to give me an @aaplog.org email address, and admin access to aaplog.org.

*** report

Donna,

I'm going to try to give you regular, formal updates, to keep myself accountable and to facilitate clear communication.

I finished consolidating all of your and AAPLOG's files into one place (the big laptop). This includes all the files from the big laptop, the "travelbuddy" laptop, your personal flash drive, and the various flash drives and harddrives in the office. This is temporary. Once all the files are more or less organized, I will start the process of acquiring and setting up a physical server, which will be their permanent home.

Feel free to continue using the big laptop for QuickBooks, but please tell me if you need to use it for anything else, or if you want to move any of the other files.

I finished my attempts to recover data from the formatted harddrive. Unfortunately, no files were recoverable.

I started to organize the files, then decided to take care of your accounts first. What I mean to do is enter records of all your online accounts (both AAPLOG-related and personal) into a passwword manager, update your relevant contact information on all of them, change all passwords and security questions to make sure they're secure, and then destroy your paper records of your accounts.

I finished entering all of your paper records (from the 3x5 holder) into a KeePass2 file, and have started the process of updating them and changing passwords. When I'm done, I'll orient you with your password manager, but until that time, if you have any trouble logging into something, text or email me.

Mixed in with all the other papers in your file were a few that seem misplaced and entirely unrelated to the work I'm doing. I have clipped these together and put them on your desk where you usually put your laptop.

Questions for you:

1. There are a number of names, business cards, emails, and phone numbers in your 3x5 holder. Do you have an existing contacts-database (such as your Gmail account) that you'd like me to add these to? Or would you like me to simply email them all to you? Or, if you're having trouble keeping your contacts organized, I could add that to my task list.

2. Am I correct in my presumption that djhobgyn2012@gmail.com is your general email address, and admin@aaplog.org is used in your capacity as ED of AAPLOG? If not, can you tell me exactly what each is used for? Also, are any of the following email addresses currently in use?

djhobgyn@gmail.com
prolifeob@gmail.com
prolifeob2013@gmail.com
donna@aaplog.org
djhteacher@wildblue.net
communications@aaplog.org
admin@watsonbowesinstitute.org
aaplogresearchinstitute@gmail.com
dharrison@melisainstitute.org

3. Your ABOG account lists your MI license as expired as of January of this year. Is this accurate/relevant?

Did a little bit of work on old accounts.
Downloaded outstanding data on Google Drives and Dropbox. Did not delete these files from the sites, as it's hard to tell exactly who has access to what.

**** 15:20-16:50 1.50 consolidating/updating contacts, organizing files, backing up files

Got all contacts out of KeePass2.
Got pretty much all files backed up onto both harddrives (as well as the big laptop); will do organization on the Passport drive.

I told Mom I'd more or less finished what I thought I could usefully do without further direction. She talked a bit about AAPLOG's needs. Said that in the near future she might want to trial me as her assistant. For now, what I will work on is finding out exactly what documents a nonprofit board may be required to produce, and making sure they are readily producible. Also, I will move towards scanning many of AAPLOG's backlogged paper files (first step: pricing document scanners).

Mom asked me to critique aaplog.org. In other words, browse the site, try to use it to find relevant information, and note anywhere where the site fails.
Specific questions I ought to try to answer, using the site:
- How does abortion affect mental health?
-- Or preterm birth?
-- Where are the studies/evidence supporting this?
- How do I donate?

Mom also gave me access to the AAPLOG calendar and asked me to organize some of her upcoming trips (that is, organize the eletronic and physical files she uses to stay organized during her trips - itineraries, basically).

AAPLOG's dealing with a regulation where to ask for donations they have to go through regulations, for all that documentation, as they come in, Mom's scanning them and sending them to the lawyers, but I should also double-check that she's done so. Each one should be in:
AAPLOG storage > Organization > Fundraising > State Registrations
When I CONFIRM that it's in there, I turn it sideways.
When I confirm that it's NOT in there, I need to scan it, put it sideways, put it in there, and make sure a copy gets sent to the lawyers' office.
As Mom said, if it's not in that folder, she didn't send it to the lawyers.

*** email report to Mom

Here is my report on the transportation for the MBEC. The numbers for my own hours spent working, and for the total money spent, are as accurate as possible; the other numbers are *fairly* accurate. This is because throughout the conference, a number of people either got rides at the last minute, cancelled their rides, found other rides, rescheduled, etc., and I didn't consider it vital to exactly record all these instances, as I was pretty busy already.

- Total people contacted regarding transportation: ~85
- People declining all rides: ~25
- People who never responded: ~5
- Remaining people who received at least one ride: ~55
- Rides given by people working with AAPLOG: 23 (13 from me, 5 each from Elle and Daniel)
- Other drivers enlisted: Joel Brind (2 rides), Brian Kilpatrick (1 ride, I think), Cara Buskmiller (1 ride), Georgeena George (1 ride)
- My hours spent organizing transportation: 48
- Hours spent providing transportation: ~25 (19 from me, ~3 each from Elle and Daniel. Mine is a lot higher because I spent a lot of time on Friday waiting at O'Hare for planes to arrive, and a lot of time on Sunday talking with or picking up passengers as people changed rides or got last minute rides. Elle and Daniel told me that their rides went very smoothly and did not involve much waiting.)
- Total spent on tolls: $76.70, I think
- My gas receipts: $15.64 + $21.17 = $36.81
- My unrelated receipts: $69.10 for black ink at Staples
- Cash donations to AAPLOG, handed to me: $70 total

I will submit my hours as usual, but please remind me exactly how to submit my receipts for reimbursement.

Ultimately, I think the transportation went reasonably well, given our limitations. The 48 total hours I spent organizing things would probably have been less if I had had more lead time, and a clearer idea of what I was doing from the beginning. I want to list the particular difficulties I had:

1 - I only had about a week and a half to prepare, and many of those days my schedule only permitted me to spend a few hours working on the project. I understand that this was not my fault or yours or Lisa's, but simply an unfortunate combination of circumstances.
2 - I did not initially have clear information regarding which passengers were "essential" and "non-essential". This was particularly important to me as I felt obliged to tell people whether or not AAPLOG would reimburse them if they had to get a taxi.
3 - I did not organize the transportation back to the airport on Sunday in a very logical manner. This was due to my own lack of experience and foresight.
4 - The list you circulated on Saturday, while well-meaning, kind of backfired, for three reasons: 4.1 - More people used it to request rides than offer them. 4.2 - It was handwritten, and difficult to read. 4.3 - I wasn't able to organize Sunday's transportation until I had the list, which was at about 8 PM on Saturday.

If you want to provide transportation during future conferences, here are my suggestions, based on this conference:

1 - Assign the task of organization to someone at least two weeks before the conference starts.
2 - One person (probably the organizer) should be committed to providing and coordinating rides all of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. If possible, they should have a small, efficient vehicle, like a Prius.
3 - A second person should be committed to providing transportation all of Friday and Sunday. If possible, they should have a minivan.
4 - Rides *from* the airport should be organized ahead of time, while rides *to* the airport should be organized shuttle-style. In other words, announce that you'll be making round trips every 90 minutes, and allow people to sign up for rides on a first-come first-serve basis.

*** picking up people for conference

Assumed that all highlighted LQ rooms were being paid for by AAPLOG, except for where noted. (highlighted LQ rooms include all people for whom transportation is being provided, as well as all people in category A)

*** people not on the spreadsheet:

pronounciation?

Assume it was a typo when DJH wrote
reservation # 205 490   should have      Agnes/Juliana             Bayer/Bort

In spreadsheet, Christian Gladstad and Frances Dijeh are listed as sharing room 221575. Email says that Dijeh is sharing a room with Nankervis (not on spreadsheet).

(consider ~ing duplicate rooms with notes)

Transportation to MBEC

Mr. <>,

Hello! I'm Nathaniel, and I'm organizing transportation between the airports and the university for the AAPLOG conference.

My information is that you and Philip Pfanstiel will be driving and do not need additional assistance with transportation. Is this correct?

Thanks,



Transportation to MBEC


Dr. ,

Hello! I'm Nathaniel Rhein, and I'm organizing transportation for the AAPLOG conference, mainly between Trinity University and O'Hare. If you are flying into or out of Chicago for the conference, but don't have any current plans regarding transportation to the University, please let me know your flight times (and flight numbers), and I'll make sure there's transportation for you - either an AAPLOG driver or a local taxi service.

Also, if you do need help with transportation, would you please give me your cell number (if you have one), in case it becomes necessary to reach you quickly?

Thanks!


If you require transportation between Trinity University and O'Hare (or Midway), I may be able to help.  Unless you have other plans, I will be arranging your transportation between the airport and Trinity University.



My information says that you will be arriving at O'Hare at 6:10 AM on Saturday the 30th, AA flight 0617, and departing from O'Hare at 1:28 PM on Sunday the 1st, AA flight 2223. Is this correct?

Also, would it be possible for you to give me a cell number, in case it becomes necessary to reach you quickly?

Thanks,

Also, would you please give me your flight numbers, so that I can stay on top of things if any flights get delayed?

I have no information regarding a departure flight. If you are flying out after the conference, and require transportation to the airport, could you please provide me with the information concerning that flight?

Thanks,

Ms. Urban,

Hello! I'm Nathaniel, and I'm organizing transportation for the AAPLOG conference. Unless you have other plans, I will be arranging your transportation between the airport and Trinity University.

My information is that you will be arriving at O'Hare at 4:53 PM on Friday the 29th, United flight 5249, and departing from O'Hare at 7:33 PM on Sunday the 1st, United flight 1606. Is this correct?

Also, would you mind providing me with a cell number, in case it becomes necessary to reach you quickly?

Thanks,

*** emails 2

Dr.,

Hello! I'm Nathaniel Rhein, and I'm organizing transportation for the AAPLOG conference, mainly between Trinity University and O'Hare. There is the possibility that I may be able to provide transportation for you. If you provide me with a few details, I will get back to you as soon as I can - hopefully today, but possibly tomorrow - and tell you whether I can provide transportation, and if so, who will be picking you up and when you should expect them.

This is what I would need:
1. arrival time and flight number
2. departure time and flight number
3. a cell number where you can be reached

Again, I cannot guarantee that I will have a driver available, but I will certainly try.

Thanks!

*** email scratch

Dr. Buskmiller,

If you're still available for transportation tomorrow, one of my drivers just had to cancel, leaving me with two passengers who need rides. I'll go ahead and just give you their details, and you can get back to me about whether you're able to pick them up.

Both passengers are arriving at O'Hare - Terminal 2 at 3:12 PM (Delta flight 1612). Here's their information:

Dr. Quentin Van Meter
email: kidendo@comcast.net
cell: (678) 763-2773

Dr. Tom Benton
email: notneb@bellsouth.net
cell: (352) 222-4770

If you're able to pick them up, then what I'll do is email them with your name, cell number, and (if possible) brief description of your vehicle, and instruct them to contact you when they're ready to be picked up. If you got to O'Hare before they were ready, they have a "Cell Phone Lot", which is a free parking lot for drivers waiting for calls.

Please let me know as soon as you can whether you're able to pick these two people up.

Thanks!

Jay Cunningham: "Our meetings begin on the Sunday evening with a board dinner (provided by AUL) at 6:00pm.  While we typically do not do any official board business at this meal, this is an important team-building event and often our discussions are critical with regards to direction for AUL.  So your presence is very important.  Sometimes we invites staff to join us for this meal as well.

"The Monday meeting usually begins at 8:00am for breakfast and the business meeting starts at 8:30am and concludes around 4:00pm the same day.  In the past we have sometimes added a board dinner with special guests on Monday evening, but if we should do so you would be advised well in advance.

"You are welcome to stay any place you wish in the D.C. area.  Many of the board stay at the Hilton Garden Inn at Courthouse Square in Arlington as it is only a two-block walk to the office from there.

"We have no official dress codes for the Board, but typically the Sunday evening event is casual and people tend to be dressy on Monday.  But feel free to come in what is comfortable for you."

*** [00:08] Dr. Donna Harrison

I wanted to introduce Dr. Michelle Cretella, who is the president of the American College of Pediatricians, and a brilliant woman, and, I will have to say, one of my very dear friends. And she's going to open us up with an overview of the Chicago Declaration.

*** [00:42] Dr. Michelle Cretella

Thank you, Donna. So, as I said earlier, although we will be talking about a Hippocratic medical society, our vision is - more broadly - fighting for our right to exist, our right to practise with Judeo-Christian ethics. And on December third we presented the Chicago Declaration on Rights of Conscience and Healthcare, almost as a charter, outlining what we would protect within our medical system. And it was drafted for us by Christopher Ferrara, who is an attorney. He's the founder and president of the American Catholic Lawyers Association. And it was presented at the December third meeting - which I believe many of you also attended - and after some input, this is the final draft. And I'll simply read it out loud as you're eating.

"We are an alliance of physicians, nurses, other health professionals, directors of healthcare systems, and and attorneys, numbering more than - need a final count - but several thousand members. We stand together in support of conscience rights for all medical professionals. In particular, we are united in our conscientious commitment to the life-affirming principle of the traditional Oath of Hippocrates, which states, 'I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asks for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art.' 

"We are also committed to ensuring informed consent and self-determination for all patients. No patient should be pressured to accept procedures or outcomes dictated by political and ideological pressures. We are firmly opposed to the harmful effect that political correctness and the dictatorship of relativism have had on the medical profession, whose permanent and universally valid ethical principles must be above all such improper influences. Accordingly, we declare that

"First: Human life is inviolate and must be respected and protected, from fertilization until natural death.

"Second: All human beings, no matter how ill, disabled, or dependent, possess intrinsic dignity and inherent moral status, and are therefore entitled to equal protection under the law, and to universal human recognition and respect as persons.

"Third: No physician or other healthcare professional should be compelled to participate under threat of professional discipline, adverse employment consequences, or othwewise, in 'abortions, embryo-detructive research, assisted suicide and euthenasia,'" and this is key, "'or any other act requiring the disrespect or destruction of a human life.'

"Fourth: Physicians and other healthcare providers have the right in general not to participate - or not to be compelled to participate, under threat of professional discipline or adverse employment consequences, in any procedure that violates their conscience."

The intent there was to cover the LGBT mandates that we can face.

"Fifth: Medical decision-making should be based on the good of the patient and the individual patient-physician relationship, not on the good of the third-party payer or any other social collective.

"Sixth: Medical treatment must be based on the physician's evaluation of the truth about a patient's condition and biological nature; not on appeals to emotion, the demands of political and ideological movements, or the dictates of standard-setting organizations.

"Seventh: Physicians have the right and the duty to present to their patients honestly and compassionately the facts that - according to the physicians' ability and judgment - are necessary for informed consent treatments or procedures, or the withholding of the same.

"Eighth: The practise of medicine is both an art and a science, which recognizes human individuality and the importance of emotional, mental, and spiritual, as well as physical, health.

"Ninth: We deplore and reject all attempts to censer, alter, suppress, or punish the publication of medical evidence that contradicts prevailing beliefs and practises.

"Tenth: Physicians have the right, duty, and responsibility to speak out and act according to their conscience, moral convictions, and scientific understanding, and such principled speech and action is not a rightful basis for professional or other discipline.

"We declare these principles of conscience in the sight of the god who made us all and endowed us with the inalienable right to life and who, as our nation's founding fathers declared, is 'the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions'.

And what should be obvious is that while we are adhering to Judeo-Christian ethic for natural law principles, as our founding fathers espoused in the Declaration, we would certainly not exclude non-Christian health professionals, physicians, from participating in any system we set up.

With that introduction, Donna, would you like to introduce Farr Curlin?

*** [06:47] Dr. Donna Harrison

Thank you, Michelle. Thank you for introducing this. I'm going to introduce Dr. Farr Curlin and sort of give you some nuts and bolts, house-keeping kind of information.

The purpose of this meeting today is a follow-up from the December third meeting that we had last year. Looking at, what are the issues involved with Hippocratic medicine, and the continuation of Hippocratic medicine in this country - actually, around the world. And also, this meeting is a little different in that we really want actionable outcomes. Also, many of the speakers have prepared short talks, but we need feedback, we need your information. This is more of a discussion than presentation. So please pester the speakers with questions, and let's have a real discussion on this.

And with that, I'd like to introduce Dr. Farr Curlin from Duke University, who has done extensive work on thinking through the whole process of a Hippocratic medical society. Thank you.

*** [07:56] Dr. Farr Curlin

Thank you, Donna.

I just have some introductary comments, and then, certainly, as Donna said, welcome your thoughts and feedback, questions, and suggestions.

The first comment begins with: what is it that a proposed Hippocratic medical society would be for? And I just want to comment on the way that institutions matter for overcoming helplessness. Charles Taylor, some of you know, a philosopher - most of his focus has been on the characteristics of modernity, and what it's like to live in a modern world - said that what's a constituent feature of modern life is a sense of "learned helplessness". And that the systems that govern our lives, having become so beaurocratically complex, so multi-layered, seem to use like things that we can't change. And One of the things that institutions do, what they're necessary for, is giving people a way of organizing their actions and behavoirs together, cooperations, so they can see a way of being, or doing things differently than the conventional way, than the way that they seem to be invited to by the way things are, the dominant structures.

I think about something as straightforward as ACP or AAPLOG or my own limited experience at Duke University in our theology, medicine, and culture initiative - conference on medicine and religion. These kinds of institutions - although tiny drops in the bucket, really, in terms of the size and relative influence for those who are part of them - give an image, a picture in imagination for the way they can enact their work in healthcare - engage their work in healthcare - differently than they have before. And in a way that more aligns with what they believe to be true about themselves, about their patients, about our world. So having an institution like this, I think that the primary purpose of it is a way of responding to what we trust is a latent longing in many physicians and other healthcare practitioners to do their work in a way differently than it's currently being structured. And to do it, not just because they can make more money, or have more ease, but because they think it will more align with the truth of who they are and what the practise of medicine is for.

That's the first comment. The second is that I want to raise as a concern and as a point of conversation... the extent to which this is construed as a safe haven, versus a form of public organized action by a community of people to contend for something good. Now, any institution like this is of course going to fulfull to some extent both of those roles. But my caution about the language of "safe haven", and frankly, the language of "rights", is that those languages, in the very meaning of the words, kind of leave undisturbed the way things are. They suggest that we have some personal rights that need to be protected, and that we want the space to be ourselves; and that allows the person hearing us, who's not one of us, who's not thinking with us, to say, "Okay, so people want to carve out, they want to live in their own eclectic ideosyncratic way, fine." Insofar as this society exists in that way, I think there's some good in that. It's good to protect things that are worth protecting, but, I think - at least what excites me about the possibilitiy, and what makes me motivated to work on something like this - is that the society be a public challenge to the way things are. A public claim that good medicine just is what is described in the tradition of medicine that dates at least to Hippocrates (frankly, earlier than that; certainly visible in the Hebrews scriptures), but has been adopted and refined and built upon in the Western world for more than two thousand years; a practise of medicine that's oriented to the patient's health, and that therefore has these constituent commitments not to kill the unborn, not to kill anyone else, and basically, to not act in such a way that undermines or contradicts our commitment to the patient's health.

That's an argument that people can hear. I can tell you from personal experience speaking at medical schools around the country, people can hear the argument that it contradicts medicine to intentionally damage or destroy your patient's health. And at least recognize, woah, there's weight to that, there's something to that; and I think this society, insofar as it's going to realize its potential, should be a society that has that orientation. It's not to protect us, principally - although we certainly need protection for our positive action and we look to the law insofar as it allows it, constitutional and otherwise, for that protection - but it's to sustain and to engage and to push forward and to continue the good work of medicine to which we're committed and to which we call our colleagues to be committed.

The third comment I have before I say a couple words about the specific proposal you have in front of you is that the formation and development of the society's form is a very practical political action. And we have to take account of the practical political challenges and possibilities. So one of the key questions is, what is the flag to which we can rally? And can we have, in this society, commitments that are sufficiently substantive to hold? To have real content, to be reasonably understood as congruent with and protective of and continuing good medicine? So we're not going to have, for example, a commitment to being "patient centered", and here I think I'll just give you an example. One of the things that's very striking about the traditional marriage vows, say, in the Roman Catholic rite of marriage, or the Anglican book of common prayers rite of marriage, is you have vows that are substantive. You take this person "to have and to hold, forsaking all others, through sickness and health, richer and poorer, till death do you part." It's a pretty simple, but substantive, commitment. It's not abstract. So you don't have any vows that "I will love you with all my heart, I will not take you for granted." And a lot of people have wanted to "improve" on those vows by making them more aspirational, more exciting, more emotionally appealing, and yet that actually undermines the purpose of the vows. So, similarly, in a profession in a society like this, each one of us, we want to say things against certain people because they're really bothering us, we want to say things for what we really aspire to... and we probably shouldn't say, if this society's going to reach its potential.

So, sufficiently substantive to hold, and sufficiently limited to avoid ideosyncrasies and sectarianism. There's no perfect line here. Hippocrates was not a universal figure. He was one character. We don't even know a whole lot about him specifically. The Hippocratic movement was one movement in ancient Greece that we believe identified some things that are true and can be seen as reasonable by others. Hippocratic tradition had some ideosyncrasies. There's stuff in there about cutting for stone, that we have to think, what were they after there, and recontextualize it here. There's prayers to Apollo, and to various other Greek deities that are ideosyncrasies in that oath. Those are reasons why we have to recognize that the Hippocratic Oath is a human document, and yet, what's powerful about the Hippocratic tradition is that it was amenable... particularly as it met Christianity, and the Christian community in the second and third, fourth centuries - I think it was the third century if I remember correctly, I read Evelstine's {00:18:25 name?} book about this recently - found the oath and revised it into the form that's called the "Hippocratic Oath Insofar as a Christian May Swear It." That oath, to the best of our knowledge, is much much much more widely disseminated and influential than the original Hippocratic oath ever was. A practical test for this society, I think, will be however its commitments and its oath are construed. Is it a society to which a person could commit, at least in principle, if they were Jewish? If they're Muslim? Or even secular, insofar as they're concerned about the very demoralization of medicine to which this society responds?

So, those are practical concerns, and I think a worry that anybody should have in creating such a society is both that we make things not specific enough, or we make it too detailed and have too many commitments, so that the number of people that can gather around that flag is so limited it doesn't have any political purchase.

The proposal I have before you - I'll just identify what are to me some of its critical ambitions. One is that the society be committed to health, as an objective, which is to say a genuine - a real good, a real thing. Strangely, perhaps, I've noticed that a lot of people haven't really thought this through. Just the claim that medicine is for health does phenomenally extensive work as a criterion to distinguish what physicians are obligated to do and what they're not obligated to do. If you take up any of the kind of practises that stirred the formation of the ACP and AAPLOG and others, take them one by one, I can show you in each case that although the practise, let's say, of contraception, may be by a particular person opposed because it violates magisterial teaching of the Roman Catholic Church of God - unitive, procreative dimensions of sexuality - it also can be shown, I think, quite reasonably, to be not clearly required by a commitment to the patient's health. It's not clear that making a young woman sterile is an act congruent with the person's health, since health is expressed in part by capacity to achieve pregnancy as a young person. And obviously with abortion, assisted suicide, gender transition services, it shows how far we've gone culturally to being committed to the body having no meaning whatsoever, so we can just reshape it or renew it. Actino appeals to your sense of your own inner epxression. But even that can clearly make an argument that to change otherwise healthy secondary sex characteristics is not clearly required by a person's commitment to health, and therefore should nothing that physicians are obligated to do. And I think in this society we would say physicians should not be involved in it.

So the commitment to health is an objective for it. That can be contrasted... I have a book coming out, hopefully next year, with a colleague, Chris Tolson {00:22:12 name?}, on this framework, kind of retrieving this ancient tradition of medical ethics as a moral art, oriented to the patient's good. One way which is helpful rhetorically is to contrast a commitment to health to the commitment to patient wellbeing, where wellbeing is a subjective concept, and that is the concept that contemporary medicine persues, unapolagetically. In its language of saying, "Well, for this person, maybe for their health, THIS is important to them." And you can define wellbeing so broadly that really the only person who can decide what is for their wellbeing is the person themself. If that's what you have - you can't have a professional oriented to that. You can only have providers of healthcare services.

This commitment to health, importantly, doesn't answer every question. It allows for margins. Health is a complicated thing, and how to persue it is complicated. And it allows, within the boundaries of not intentionally damaging or destroying health, for a society to be able to continue to seek to discern whether this practise is really congruent with health, or whether it is not. And we need that kind of discernment because we can't say right now all of the practses that are worthwhile, and all that aren't.

The society will be committed to conscientious practise, which is stated in the declaration of conscience. The key in there, to me, is not a "right of conscience", again. If I hear someone declare to have a "right of conscience", and it involves me, what I hear them saying is, "I'm about me, and protecting myself from you." If we're going to be committed to our patient's health, we have an obligation to practise conscientiously. Conscientiously - the etymology of this is that we practise according to our best judgment about what we ought to do. We refuse to do the things we don't think we should do, and we do the things we believe we must do.

That is a retrieval that a lot of physicians want - we long for - insofar as it emphasizes that the positions have to have agency, use judgment, and bear responsibility. And, crucially - this is important - what we're after here, I think, is to change the dynamic. Because the end of medicine is being construed both explicitly and implcitly in contemporary medicine as patient "wellbeing", which is a subjective norm that only the patient can really fill in in a given case. With that sa a norm, the default is, you should do anything that's legal, that you can do feasibly, technically, and doesn't have an immediate threat of overt bodily harm. And if you're not going to do it, the onus is on you to say why. Why? What's your reason? How do you justify it? Insofar as we are committed to health, and committed to practising conscientiously, the dynamic flips, and then the question is, why do you think this practise you want me to participate in is so clearly required by my commitment to the patient's health? So the onus is on others to demonstrate that a particular practise is required by us, because we profess to seek our patient's health. And clearly, sometimes that can be met. So, just a little quibble with the declaration of conscience... it says somewhere that "physicians have a right to ... they can never be compelled to do anything they don't think they should do ... any procedure that violates their conscience." Well, yes and no. You can't have a profession if you don't live up to your profession. And insofar as your profession requires certain actions - let's say a woman or a man right here is having a heart attack, and I know how to do CPR, and I just stand by and don't do it because I'm tired, had a long day, then I think you could say that you've basically failed to fulfill your vocation. Much worse if you're in an ER and they show up in your ER and you don't do that. So there are clearly some things that we are required to do. But the onus is on people; when we give a conscientious claim that a particular practise is not consistent with our profession, the onus is on others to show why it must be. And when you pull up these practises that are controversial today, I think you're going to have a really hard time making that argument. And that's been my experience in debating about these things at various universities the last ten years.

Okay. We respect not so much - my language - patients' "self-determination;" we respect patients' "authority." We do not have authority over everyone. We do have authority, we believe, over our own actions, and particularly as physicians making a profession, we have authority to make judments about what our profession requires. We have to be accountable to one another, but that is our authority. We respect patients' authority, we respect its limits. And I think that the oath has to have the traditional affirmations and prohibitions: against deadly remedies, against abortion, against sex with your patients, against violating confidentiality. Those have to be contextualized with today's language. We've taken a stab - I have, that's what several colleagues have worked on - {00:28:19 name?}, who some of you know - in the oath that you have in front of you. And in my judgment, we need to not have more.

So. Again, this goes back to substantive... but not so much detail that you become very ideosyncratic. I don't think this kind of society should have dogmatic statments about healthcare financing. You can see the language I've put in there... my take on it. It seems to me that physicians of principle, in their orientation to health, are open to any kind of organization of financing in healthcare, insofar as that organization facilitates, is conducive to, doesn't pose obstacles to, or contradict their professional commitments to their patients' health. There are reasons to oppose certain healthcare financing BECAUSE of the way that they interfere... but this shouldn't be about healthcare financing, or other pet issues.

So I'll stop there. Those are my initial thoughts, and I think we have a few minutes... taking questions or comments. Donna?

*** [29:32] Dr. Donna Harrison

Okay. Having struggled as an OBGYN, and trying to articulate why we don't kill our second patient in the womb, this whole issue of "health" is a real problem. Because how you define "health" really is the whole core of it, and we have to define it because what we're committed to as private physicians is the health of our patient. I don't think you're going to be able to avoid defining that, and right now, legally, as of Doe v. Bolton, "health" is defined as "any physical, psychological, social, familial, or any other reason which affects a woman's decisions." So it's enshrined in Doe v. Bolton - the legal definition of "health" - so that's what we're going to have to come up against. So I don't know if there's another word - part of what we've wrestled with is, is there another word, like "health," which equals "wellbeing," so I would just ask you...

*** [30:30] Dr. Farr Curlin

So, we will have to say, "When we say 'health,' we mean the following..." And there's been some tremendous work in that respect. Frankly, I think the best work done in the last 50 years is by Leon Kass. And we have to make the point that health is not construed in the World Health Organization form of the "complete state of psychological, social, physical, spiritual wellbeing", but that it's a bodily good; Kass calls it "the well working of the organism as a whole," or "an activity of the body in accordance with its specific excellences," which are - you know, kind of clunky, in a way, but the point is, you can't make sense of the Hippocratic affirmations and prohibitions, apart from in death {00:31:26 ?}, if you define health as broadly as it's been defined. So we would have to clarify that.

*** [31:34] Dr. Michelle Cretella

So, I think - to what you opened with - that, you're right, this is the process of contending not just "Oh, let us be, let us practise the way we want" - we're contending, we're putting an argument out there, this is what real medicine is. This is how you bring about human lordship. And it comes back to combining maybe what we know about good medicine and science with an actual law. We can't escape that this is a philosophical... we got here because of the Enlightenment kicking God out of science. So, we definitely need to bridge that gap. So, definitions... the language matters.

*** [32:22] Dr. Farr Curlin

The language matters.

*** [32:24] woman

I have a couple questions about consent and confidentiality.

As a pediatrician, I give an awful lot of shots to kids that don't consent to it. You know, until a child reaches a certain age, then the parents consent for the child, but that's not in the way that this is worded.

And then, on the confidentiality, parents need to know if their kids are experimenting with drugs, if their kids are having sex. Even if the children are not in imminent serious harm, they're still putting themselves at harm. And I think a little tweaking of the language there would be helpful - the last point: "never divulge confidential information about a patient."

*** [33:35] Dr. Farr Curlin

That's a very important thing - I think that's an important footnote, probably, that has been regarded as such for centuries - and that's where I think the language of authority is important. Kids don't have authority to make their own choices, at least, not all their own choices, not all their healthcare choices, so we respect the authority of those who have that authority. Their parents, in this case. By "authority" here I don't just mean legal authority, I mean reasonable moral authority to make these choices.

Others? Yes?

*** [34:16] Dr. Lester Ruppersberger

I think one of the things that people ... [indistinct] wrong is, if confronted with the reason why we wouldn't do a particular treatment or a particular surgery or a particular action based on conscience, that it would be incumbent upon us to provide that explanation. The difficulty is that we're all encumbered now under this mantra of evidence-based medicine, and whose evidence, and what gets published, and where it gets published, and what is more generally accepted - and there are things that go into the formation of conscience, in my view, that are beyond scientific evidence. There is an intuitive moral and spiritual element that whispers to us, if you will, in knowing the difference of what's right and what's wrong. Although we may not have overwhelming evidence to say otherwise, I don't see how that would compromise our justification of making that decision. Because if we're debating this with someone else on the other side, "Why don't you do gender reassignment surgery as an OB/GYN?" and I explain it to them, "Well, that's not what the literature says, that's not what's in the ACOG journals," or this and that and the other one, and they would be right from the preponderance of what is published. But just because it's published in a journal in the United States doesn't mean that that is the end all and be all evidence of what is the right thing.

*** [36:07] Dr. Farr Curlin

This is an example of the kind of thing that, as I imagine, a society of Hippocratic medicine (or however the title is put)... societies have to get formed around some core commitments, and then within that community, you're going to need dialuge and literature and articles and training that help people understand, for example, how we make sense of evidence-based medicine; what are the limits of evidence; in our making clinical decisions, what part does scientific evidence play, and what are the limits of the part that it plays. We'd have, I imagine, these well-written, cogent articles about this that people have access to; materials that physicians could share with their patients and share with their colleagues; and position statements, even. But we wouldn't have a dogmatic claim, it seems to me, about how people have to think about evidence-based medicine, so much as we want to point out the way that these commitments - commitment to health, commitment to sustain medicine as it's been traditionally practised - as implications for how we think of evidence-based medicine.

Yes?

*** [37:37] man 2

I'm new to this organization, and new to this newest organization you're trying to launch. As for my cultural, psychological, spiritual perspective, I consider myself and others as "healthcare providers." Sometimes it would be safer not to use the term "physician," but "healthcare providers," and a few <indistinct> can say "physician," "nurse," "clinicians," "practitioners."

*** [38:10] man 3

I disagree. So, the "provider" language was introduced by HMOs in the 90s. It was fought against by physician organizations as a de-professionalization term to try to marginalize anyone to a technocratic field; that if you just had a couple of pet procedures... it's a replaceable part in a machine. I fight against the use of the word "provider" in even my secular health system language, because I think it diminishes and marginalizes the profession as a profession. Instead of interchangeable parts... I think Farr in his language does extend an opportunity for non-physicians to be part of the movement, but... if physicians don't lead, physicians will not have healthcare. Physicians in other countries have been taken out of the whole conversation.

*** [39:11] Dr. Farr Curline

If I could, I want to appreciate something you're saying. I think you're alluding to the fact that medicine - at least in my understanding - is not just practised by physicians. Medicine is that domain of human activity oriented to preserving and restoring patients' health and those whose health is threatened or diminished. When a nurse practitioner takes care of someone who's sick, he or she is practising medicine.

*** [39:37] man 2

My point is to open this up, hopefully, for future healthcare practitioners, or...

*** [39:45] various

Clinicians.

Professionals.

But not "providers."

*** [39:52] man 2

<indistinct> one point. The other is what Michelle was trying to say - seems like you're starting a new organization - separating ourselves from some mainstream, creating something - at the same time, challenging the mainstream, modern belief system, ideology, technology, and so forth. So maybe that's a dual vision and mission we can do, because sometimes separating can be exploration <uncertain>. But we need to stay engaged in American psychological institution. Most of them, they go on, practising, spiritual person... <indistinct> a member of other Christian psychological institution, but also a member of that. So, challenging and retraining <possibly "reframing"> psychology and medicine in its original form - and of course there will be some battle along the way - also we can start another one and then can open with <indistinct>. Other point about... number eight...

*** [41:07] Dr. Farr Curlin

You're looking at the declaration.

*** [41:09] man 2

...which recognizes human individuality and the importance of emotional, mental, and spiritual, as well as physical, health [uncertain]. Perhaps it would be good to not emphasize only on the individualism, but include collectivism as well. Cause we are social and cultural beings as well. We cannot exist without - so individualism and collectivism would be recognized. And include the term "social" or "cultural" <uncertain>, as well. <indistinct> Every profession has a common code of ethics and legal procedures, so we are obliged to stay with that, but yet now we cannot say, "No, [what] our conscience tell[s] us [is a] little different than the code of ethics." So that becomes a symmetric discussion, as well. Where are we in common with that code of ethics, and where do we break and say, "No, our ethics is higher or different..." <indistinct>

*** [42:18] Dr. Donna Harrison

So if you can respond to that, Farr, and then we'll go to break.

*** [42:22] Dr. Farr Curlin

So I just want to say... in terms of my speaking about the document - I was talking about the ones like - five pages, it's on white paper - we have a society of Hippocratic medicine... you know, Ryans <unsure> being here reminds me of something that's in my mind a lot - may not be in all of yours - but I want to put it on the table. This goes back again to "substantive, but not too ideosyncratic." Roman Catholics have a long tradition of affirming natural law, and move pretty fluidly with the idea that reason can see clearly what medicine is for, an dso on. For the most part, Protestants have adopted a lot of that reasoning - if they're what I'll call "conservative Protestants." Liberal Protestantism has gone pretty fully into the idea that wellbeing is something that each person has to discern on their own. But there are Jewish, Muslims, Orthodox Christians, and others, [who] have challenged whether there is any such things as a rational knowledge of what health is that we have access to outside of the community of church and sacraments and tradition over receiving, and so would say, you really need to be practising medicine as the church teaches you, not according to a timeless form that Hippocrates discerned. I find those critiques... certainly my Jewish colleagues who are orthodox say, "You know, look, the key for us to practise medicine is [that] the commitment to the patient's health is very much a part of our tradition." When you get to the details 


Dr. So I just wanna say I was ... in terms of my speaking about the doc- I was talking about the ones, like five pages, it's on white paper, we have a society of hippocratic medicine,... you know, Ryans being here reminds me of something that's in my mind a lot - may not be in all of yours - but I wanna put it on the table - this goes back again to "substantive but not too ideosyncratic". Roman Catholics have a long tradition of affirming natural law, and move pretty fluidly with the idea that reason can see clearly what medicine is for and so on. For the most part, Protestants have adopted a lot of that reasoning if they're what I'll call "conservative protestants". Liberal protestantism has gone pretty fully into the idea that wellbeing is something that each person has to discern on their own. But there are Jewish, Muslim[s], Orthodox Christians, and others have challenged whether there is any such thing as a rational knowledge of what health is that we have access to outside of the community of church and sacraments and tradition over receiving, and so would say, you really need to be practising medicine as the church teaches you. Not according to a timeless form that Hippocrates discerned. I find {the/that} critique from those critiques - certainly my Jewish colleagues who are orthodox say, "You know, look, we practise - the key for us to practise medicine is one: the commitment to the patients' health is very much a part of our tradition. When you get to the details, it's what the Halakha - the law - requires. And we wouldn't expect anybody to follow that. That is a Jewish thing."

I would be supportive of this socienty not making claims about... it's one thing to commit to things like "We're not going to practise abortion," "We're not going to give our patients deadly remedies," "We're going to persue the patient's health" - those are things that are intelligible to everybody - and we can recognize people are going to argue on the margins about what health requires. It's another thing to sort of say "The natural law holds the following..." Or that we have a particular construal that anybody who's reasonable would see. And I think insofar as we slide toward that, we're going to find that we get narrower and narrower - even of those who consider themselves Christians - who can be onboard. This is a practical political challenge. It's like <indistinct> Abraham Lincoln, who I've become rather infatuated with, over the last ten years, reading biographies of his, and how he had to find ways of pulling together those who could be pulled together to enact legislation and take steps politically that he thought were the best, and it was hard to do, and insofar as you want to get everything into a - let's say a piece of legislation, or form a society, you'll find that you kind of break down <indistinct> actually getting a political movement going.

*** [00:01] Dr. Donna Harrison

Dr. Curlin, thank you very much for sort of setting a practical stage for this. I want to take a minute and just recognize some of the different groups that are here, because I realize a lot of you may not know each other. We have the board of the American Associaton of Pro-Life OB/GYNs - if you just will briefly stand up and sit down, so that people know... we have members of the American Association of Pro-Life OB/GYNs, thank you Dr. {00:28 name}. The board of the American College of Pediatricians - if you'd just briefly stand up and sit down...

Our speakers are a number of different experts from around the country, who[m] you will know about - I would ask the speakers to each just briefly say a word or two about who they are and where they're coming from.

We also have representatives from Franciscan Alliance - if you wou would stand up and sit down. They're a large health organization. We have legal representatives from Thomas More Society, who has graciously volunteered to help us with the legalities of this. We have representatives from - very important - Samaritan ministries - if you would briefly just stand up and sit down. Thank you. Samaritan Ministries being one of those grandfathered organizations that was exempt from the Affordable Care Act, and so supports rights of conscience for physicians. And then, other organizations... I'm going to not be able to identify everybody... so please do not take offense... because I want to go right on to Dr. Ryan Nash. Dr. Ryan Nash is the director of the Center for Bioethics at Ohio State University. So, Dr. Nash, if you would take it from here.

*** [01:55] Dr. Michelle Cretella

Did you want to verify <indistinct>

*** [01:58] Dr. Donna Harrison

One important thing. Dr. Curlin has given a proposal for a separate 501(c)(3), and we haven't, as boards, or as a society here, clarified whether we want this thing that we're doing to look like a coalition of different organizations, or a separate organization. So that will be one of the things that we'll have to discuss and sort of hash out. But it isn't a {02:34 ?}.  We're in the process of thinking about, "What should this look like, what does this mean?" Thank you.

*** [02:44] Dr. Ryan Nash

Howdy. I always feel, whenever I'm in the same room with Farr Curlin - I always feel like I become the BAD talk.

So, Donna asked me to make some comments, and I'm going to be very candid.

I am for this movement, and I want it to be a positive movement. It's funny to me that there are other things going on in the culture that are doing similar things. I mean, I think of {03:36 name?}, where he's asking the same questions. How much should we be trying to change the culture and claim the Christian heritage of the United States, or how much should we try to wall off and protect our culture, when we're under an onslaught? I think that this is a larger societal question; that medicine is a very important kind of microcosm of that larger debate. I'm a both-and kind of guy. I think we have to prepare. I'll get to the language use later. Everyone's going to see right through it. And it is going to be attacked, it's going to be attacked hard, it's going to be marginalized, and it's going to be marginalized in a way - especially if it tries to use secular language - that is going to be very powerful, and may even marginalize many of the people that are preactising. It's a dangerous thing. I think we cannot overstate the kind of tumultuous times we're in.

The recent election - and President Trump, whether you're a fan of his or not - has uncovered a societal rage that I think gives us all pause. I focus... so, some biases: I'm a Texan, so that explains a lot. I'm loud, I'm obnoxious <laughter>... I'm a rabid anti-communist. I'm an anti-Marxist. And I see a MASSIVE leftward push, created by the chaos around the opportunity to conflate anyone who is a peace-loving Christian with a Neo-Nazi, a Confederate, a neo-whatever; to try to make anyone who's Conservative right up there with the greatest evil scourge of Satan himself. And I'm afraid this looks like it's going to be remarkably successful. Remarkably successful. 

So I agree with the urgency. I mean, we're about twenty years behind. It's a shame that when we had someone like {06:03 name?}, we didn't make more progress. Would [that] we had someone like that now (even though I don't agree with ALL his of his positions). But I think we're in dangerous times, and I don't think it could be overstated. I mean, look, I have {06:23 ?} major secular university. I am attacked from faculty at that university for being Christian. Not even over specific positions; not even over specific claims, or policies, or practises, or speeches, or papers; just the thought of someone who is Christian, and may actually have hired <gasp> another Christian to work for me, is scandalous in {06:48 ? official reports?}. The president of our university will offer all kinds of condolences [and] offers of solidarity with anyone who feels marginalized on the Left, but - and I pointed out to him - he nver makes such gestures to those that maybe are on the Right, or people of faith; the physicians that are in and out of my office, saying, "I don't know if I can do this. I don't know if I can do this practise any more. What are they going to have me do next?"

We are at the death-throes of European Western Christendom. I'm an Orthodox Christian, I could theologically say that may have happened a long time ago, but as far as culture goes, European Christian culture is in its death throes. If there is going to be a movement, I think it needs to be not an academic movement merely, yet it needs to be an academic movement. It need not be just a professional safe haven movement, but it needs to be that. It needs to be a bold movement that proclaims a correction of history - though I would avoid certain parts of history that we can get into. I would avoid Nazi Germany. I would just avoid it. It's not an historical study that we need to be in. I view that the Stalinists were one of the greatest scourges to ever hit the face of the earth; I think Hiroshima and Nagasaki were horrible crimes against mankind; we could make all kinds of comments on the outpouring of violence around world wars. But I would not form a society based on that. I wouldn't want any language... I'm going far afield...

But all I'm saying is that we have a critical time to try to reclaim something that is kind of a Western Christian medicine. And we'll likely do this. But for many of us, what we'll have to say [is], "Is it worth fighting for? Is it worth losing my physician for? Is it worth being the target [of] a very active resistance?" If we ARE going to do this, we should actually learn from the resistance - the people that resist us. The progressives that hav erun some of the most amazingly successful grassroots campaigns over the last thirty years. If you look at the LGBTQ+ movement, it is remarkably successful. I mean, imagine the kind of conversations that, even in the mid-80s, even in the mid 90s, you get in 2005, even four years ago - the kind of success of bringing a grassroots movement... I think we can actually look to our opposition, those who oppose us, for some tips on how to do it successfully. But I think it must be bold.

So the need, I think, has been articulated. And it often is thought about as around abortion, and contraception and reproductive technologies - although some Protestant groups will accept contraceptive technologies. And some other groups... of course, we know that Roman Catholics, as a people, accept them quite well, even though the traditional church doctrine says otherwise. Similarly, Orthodox. We have a bigger problem: we don't reproduce. We have a major reproduction issue. The American Christians, and European Christians, just don't reproduce. And so, in a few generations, we'll be less relevant, unless the Gospel proceeds without us.

So contraception [and] reproductive technologies are issues within medicine. Assisted suicide and voluntary active euthenasia, now cleverly rebranded as "physician-aided dying," is now legalized in Canada and will be legal in every state in the United States in the short term, I do believe. Along with it, voluntary active euthenasia. I hope I'm... but I think it will be coming to a neighborhood near you.

"Gender reassignment" is going to be where the health language fails. I mean, it's success, but it's already failed - and reproductive technologies and abortion. Because "women's health" won the day - by redefining "women's health" - after following all kinds of debauchery being what we call "health." So the reframing of "health," now that gender dysphoria is a disorder, and it needs a specific, efficient treatment. Tha tis not proven, of course, but we need a study, actually, to prove it may be eventually harmful. That is gender reassignment. Those studies are underway. All you have to do is change the endpoint. If you can make the endpoint, "I am self-satisfied with my new status," then all of the sudden you have "empirical" data showing that something does improve health and meets the new standard of care. So I think the "health" language games is up, unless you define it specifically. At Ohio State University, the official furthering of Buddhism and mindfulness and yoga for health and wellness is officially endorsed, while no Christian practises are furthered. So anti-Christian and non-Christian definitions of "health" are furthered, while the Christian one is silent.

So I think there's a need, in defining "health," that we take trascendent. Tim Quill {13:39 name}, when he was saying why assisted suicide was so good, used this image of someone going off into the sunset. Prove that one! Maybe they're going somewhere else. Maybe really hot. May not be a sunset. So if you're going to take the eternal eschatological consequences seriously - transcendent arguments - we must insist that a definition of "health" is not just imminence and efficiency, but is also about trascendent eschatological health. I mean, look, the soul doesn't die. And eternity's a whole lot longer than our usual lifespan. And whether we're healthy in soul, whether we have {14:30 ?}, whether we have spiritual life, that should be - and was - the main care of the Christian Hippocratic Movement. It was not the main care of other Hippocratic movements.

And, of course, we have an attack on conscientious practise. I liek "conscientious practise" over "conscientious refusal" or "objection," because we're practising conscientiously. I don't like "rights" language. There's kind of the French human rights tradition - {15:01 name?}, Voltaire; there's the {15:03 name?} rights language; and they're very different "rights" language[s]. Then there's the American kind of "come all" tradition of rights. They're just different. So I prefer "conscientious practise."

So, I travel, too. The main people that I know that have a problem with all these issues... I mean, I can find some Orthodox Jews that are concerned, but they're pretty well walled off. They have their community and they can nullify, de facto, because they have a normal {15:34 ?} option - already happening. The same is happening with conservative Muslims. They have the ability to practise within their movement, their community, even if there is a de jour requirement for something. They can nullify because they can maintain their practise with like-minded patients and individuals, and the insurance probably would never know. The people that I know that have problems with the issues that we're concerned with, are Christian. So this is one of the conversations that Farr {name} and Dan {name} and I often have: how the Christian can ultimately be, if something like this is to move forward. And [we] can divide things into several categories. I'd say there's a functionalist argument, that Farr {name}, I think, furthers, and Dan {name} furthers. I think Farr's {name} more essentialist than Dan {name}. So, the functionalist [argument] is that we could reduce the society down to certain principles that are agreed upon [by] physicians. The essentialist is... me. That Christ changes everything. Just everything. So, the definition of "health" changes. So, I further that there is something inherently different about the different Hippocratic traditions; between the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian Hippocratic traditions. Medical history is a shameful mixed bag of practises on all those issues. Calling upon the history of medicine is dangerous. You're going to die by that same sword. Look, euthenasia was practised throughout history, even in Christian, Hippocratic eras. I wouldn't say that it was a good, faithful, Christian practise, of course, but calling upon historical claims is not sufficient.

So, Christ changes all. If you create an organization that includes non-God-fearing Christians - so, I'm not talking about theological differences between Reformed Evangelicals and Orthodox and Roman Catholics that are traditionalist - I'm going to lump all those kind of Evangelical Christians and traditional Roman Catholics and traditional Orthodox into one thing and just say that they're God-fearing Christians - if you allow non-God-fearing Christians into your group, you can and you should expect departure, or else you don't pay attention to organizations and history. There is going to be departure. So I hold, and I encourage, that the group, however it's formed, have leadership, vision, and control, set by God-fearing physicians that claim Christ as Lord. And that there be a mechanism that that is perpetuated. Explicitly. If not, this will be a flash in the pan and it will go away. It will depart. It will go along with the zeitgeist. Because it will be so politically incorrect. Look, you have to be willing to be a martyr in order to withstand this. Be honest. You can't be a politican. Politicians have to go by which way the wind blows. Others may be allowed, so I'm not saying that it must be... I would be for the formatino of a Christian Hippocratic society. I think it would be great. I think we have some roots for that in Christian organizations already. I'd be for that, if someone wants to further that. I think in December, most people were not for a Christian Hippocratic society. I would be. But you could make membership broader through a functionalist way. For instance, expanding to non-God-fearing Christians, and expanding to non-physicians. You could do that in a functionalist way based on certain concepts of health, certain prohibitions and prescriptions. Fewer prescriptions than prohibitions. In December, I questioned, "Why Hippocratic?" {personal} And, I actually kind of like it, now. As I study more of the Christian Hippocratic positions, I like it. I don't like basing ethics in kind of a new Hippocratism, but that's another whole conversation.

Orthodox, traditional Catholics, Protestants... theologically conservative... the essential is fear of God and lordship of Christ. So that needs to be [in the] leadership. Division needs to be planted by that, it needs to be perpetuated somehow, or else I don't have any hope for this being true. It may be effective, but it wouldn't be true.

So, another one. "Is Christian medicine lost?" is one of the questions. I mean, I think, especially in training - so, {Donna} asked me to think about training - many of you know far more about this because, I think, OB/GYN, and now pediatrics quickly on its tails, are the two specialties that are facing such a great run. If I have a pro-life medical student in my office, and she says, "I want to be an OB/GYN," I say, "Oh, are you sure? You know how hard that's going to be? Do you know hohw hard it's going to be to find the right training porgram? I mean, just to survive and get a good evaluation on your rotation, if you let them know - I mean, if it's public - and, wow, I mean, you're going to have to really play a game on who you divluge that to, and what you'll participate in, and that's hard." Have you all had that same experience? I mean, I think psychiatry's very difficult. There are a few psychiatrists that respect religious experience, but they're... I know religious people that have been accused of being psychotic... when they were doing something completely consistent with their faith. I'v eknown trainees that have been accused of problems because they actually accepted the tenets of their traditional faith. Pediatrics - palliative medicine, I think - is moving quickly to formally endorse assisted dying. I was on that ethics committee for {AHBM? 22:53}. {I} tried and failed to change their physician-aided dying statement. But I think it's quickly moving there. Inspirated {? 23:05} medicine is, increasingly, only about a spiritual type of care that's foreign to Christianity, and actually at odds with it. And even, according to church fathers, demonic. At law, we know in Canada that physician-aided dying is now the law of the land and a right for their citizenry, and they had a great debate, and continually [have a] great debate over whether conscientious refusal, or conscientious practise, will be allowed by Canadian physicians. And Canadian physicians have essentially been silenced. They have no clout. The yhave no credibility. So they're being regulated without a legitimate voice of authority in this debate, as best I can assess. And the debate is going, predictably, the way of abortion in the United States. This will be a question of conveyance. Whether it's legitimate enough: if you have no physician in a given territory that will provide physician-aided dying, whether it is a reasonable burden for the patient to transfer to another regiion in order to procure that legal medical treatment. And you will likely have kind of a Canadian Planned Parenthood for physician-aided dying coming soon. Or, you can get rid of conscientious practise, which is now just a small regulation - it's not in the statutes, it's just in the regulation. They can change that fairly easily. Oregon - of course, the Death with Dignity Act has one of the strongest conscientious refusal clauses. It's only a couple sentences, but it's fairly easy to remove those over time. And if you don't know, Roman Stahl {25:04 name?} and Zeke Emmanuel - Zeke Emmanuel should be at least a household name - wrote in April {25:11 ?} journal medicine calling for all medical societies to ban conscientious practise.

It gets worse.

So, regulations and outcome-based medicine. The outcome-based medicine has the potential of creating a tautology. It's a wonderful political tool for creating a tautology. It's like gender-reassignment: if you create an outcome that has to be self-reported - "I no lonegr feel dysphoric" - then... by circular reasoning you can create a new definition of "healthm" one that is built upon an epistomology of self-gratification. So, outcome-based medicine is actually an enemy to traditional medicine when it is applied in such a way. It can be used as a tool, a political tool, to redefine "health." Redefine "medicine." And then regulations come to enforce these. I advise for a couple of insurance companies, and it's amazing how much things like managed Medicaid [are] demanding consideration of practises, including gender-reassignment. CMS has mandated that insurances that are doing managed Medicaid or Medicare cannot deny gender-reassignment as a policy; they have to take [it] case by case. And, of course, the activist groups are looking for the test case to bring more suits to what could have been a very different supreme court. Who knows, now, what it would do. I don't know. Maybe our legal friend would know better. The regulations of outcome-based medicine are a challenge to traditional Christian medicine. I mean, look, you have a society that doesn't have any appreciation for suffering. I often have said that the French philosopher Claudia {27:34 name?} talks about the shift of a society from the trinity of traditional humanism - liberty, fraternity, equality - which was a product of the Enlightenment - to the new humanism, which is really a hedonism, of health, security, and the persuit of pleasue, with the persuit of pleasure being the chief goal, and with suffering being the greatest enemy. Orthodoxy doesn't share the same kind of redemptive suffering theology as Roman Catholics, but we have a clear place of finding God in the midst of suffering - an appreciation of suffering as reality that medicine should not try to totalize {28:18 ?}. And many Protestants have come to similar conclusions.

I think Christian medicine has been lost. I don't think this task is merely trying to claim something that is; it's trying to recapture what has already been lost.

So, my specific task is to try to say, "How can we impact students in medical schools?" I think we can use something like the Gold Humanism in Medicine model, that made a big impact in different medical schools, but I don't think that's sufficient. If you have kind of the spokes of your wheel... you can think of how we can impact medical students. So, Gold Humanism in Medicine - which I actually think will be quite contrary to this movement - I mean, I think it has some leaders [who] would be sympathetic, but I think there are also many [who] would think it was very problematic - they became a student organization, but also they become known for their lapel pins. They became part of the White Coat Ceremony. They became part of a kind of de facto second honor's society, beside Alpha Mega Alpha, for medicine. They gave awards out to students, and they've been incorporated into medical schools across the country in a very effective way. So I think they can be a model.

Easy partnerships... CMDA - Christian Medical Dental Association, I think, is one of the main vehicles that should be used, along with Catholic Medical Association. (There is no Orthodox medical association that I know. There's a group that holds a conference, but they're... not the right people. They're just not.) Benjamin Rush Institute - fascinating new institute that has got a lot of energy fairly quickly. These are mainly conservative and libertarian medical students that are focused more about the freedom and the financing in medicine, but I think it's a very important group that can be partnered with. AAPS could be [a] good vehicle for this. And I think what the vehicles are doing are trying to find champions. Champions at specific institutions. We need academic credibility. I don't think it needs to be an academic movement MERELY; it needs to be a multifaceted movement. But it needs academic credibility in order for medical schools to embrace it, because there will be opposition.

So, I think the initial targets... I'll get there... I love the idea of an advertising campagin, of saying, "Is your doctor a Hippocratic doctor? Do you know who you're getting your healthcare from? Is your college, your medical school, a Hippocratic medical school?" I think there's still a large enough group of conservative-minded people, God-fearing people, and Christian people, that this could still be effective. And I think that, actually, we can take a note from those who are trying to have a massive push left, and create a counter-movement, to say, "Yes, we are in culture wars; we're coming apart as a nation; and there should be medicine that holds to a tradition that is Christian and Hippocratic in character." Do we need another student group, or coalition of existing student groups? I think both. I think a Hippocratic medical society should have a student group arm, and I would see that student group arm as acting as an opportunity for these various student groups to come together. This already happens; CMDA and CMA often have joint meetings and joint alliances. I mean, Ohio State is a pretty small gathering. At UVA and Alabama where I was before {personal details}, if I had a tlak, I would have three hundred people. So, I think we can do both.

Initial targets... I think there's some obvious Christian-in-name medical centers like {33:24 ?}, and others, several others... but I think, strategically, we need a few prominent secular centers right off the bat. And it doesn't launch until you have those secure, and you can get those secure pretty quickly. I think we may have some sympathetic deans and university presidents in a couple of different instutitions. I have a couple in mind. I may be wrong, because they may be shackled by their public relations people/

Graduate medical education residency programs are often neglected in any movement that tries to engage medical schools. I think including them from the beginning is necessary. And giving energy to the CMA and the CMDA to try to reach residency programs would be an added benefit. This can be done though various program[s]... prepare them to be Bippocratic physicians when they practise... So, preparing graduate medical education between residents and internts - how they can find a practise, how they can find funding mechanisms and hospitals that will allow them to practise medicine in a way that they want - I think, will be [a] unique opportunity for a Hippocratic medical society - to further this kind of education. So they need to be involved from the beginning - not once further things are established.

One of the mechanisms that a Hippocratic medical society needs to have, because there's going to be so much blowback, is reporting and assistance offerings. So there needs to be a website, a hotline, a way that students and residents can report problems as they encounter them, and there needs to be on-the-ground faculty champions at different institutions, and national representation, and the potential for legal support, when those things happen. So we need support for the anticipated blowback.

I'm going to strongly encourage that a Hippocratic medical society try to branch into bioethics. I'm in a couple of leadership groups {and} I see some very concerning trends. I think there is an activist move left. The Association of Bioethics Program Directors is now offering public position statements that are nothing but anti-Trump political tools. They recently signed on something that was pro Daka {36:09 ?}. I pointed that out to them; I sent them a speech by Robert Jordan {name?} in 1995, and Bill and Hillary Clinton in 2005 - you know, really recently - saying, "Why is this now the really important issue, and what does bioethics have to say over Daka {?}?" You're being used as a political tool against this." But I was one of two votes against, and there were sixty-seven votes for. Bioethics {is} becoming a political tool to say, "We hate Trump." Within that organization, there's already been a proposal for a position statement against religious freedom. I don't know if you heard that. There's already been a proposal for a position statement in bioethics against religious freedom.

It's worse, because bioethics, like medicine, and like some other specialties - like chaplaincy, for instance - is pursuing credentialing standards that I believe are intentionally pushing submission {37:16?} down the field. And I'd love to talk to lawyers in the room. I think we have to have legal faces in all of this. I think it's time to lawyer up, if we're going to fight back. I really do. This is an anti-trust case. Bedside clinical decision-making, last I checked, was constituent of physicians' practise, and now there's a credentialing body trying to say, "We philosophers and others are going to own the really really hard cases." In bioethics. And the credentialing and accreditation process is becoming too onerous for physicians... So, you're going to have a reality of ethics in medicine being decided outside of medicine, and definitely bioethics programs, with a couple of exceptions, are largely anti-Christian. I may be stating things with hyperbole, [but] I don't think so. There are a couple of Christian programs, but as a large part, they are not. So, I would say that we need to include bioethics in all we do, including, potentially, forming alternative credentialing accreditation for bioethicists and bioethics programs.

Again, {Donna} asked if we could do something harder. It's become something I don't want to think about, which is the conscientious objection matter. I don't know enough about it. Someone will have to fill in that gap. I know there's some things happening in Mississippi, but I think that something on the federal level... I don't know enough about it, but I think that the grassroots effort - if there was an effort, I didn't know about it - it shows that the grassroots wasn't good enough. The role of a Hippocratic medical society, I think, would be key, and I can see if that's an alignment point that could be one of the things that spreads, launches the Hippocratic medical society, saying, "We're going to get this act passed," and then, as we create relationships and alliances and coalitions, THAT is our first action point, so we don't just say, "Hey, we want you to be a member of this society." We say, "Hey, sign on to this, let's do this together - and while you're at it, join this societ." ...Giving them an action point along the way. I think there's [a] definite need from the beginning to have things like white papers {39:57 ?} and statements that show that there's been a lot of thought that went into this medical society. Having a website - you don't exist unless you have one, apparently, in the modern era - but it does really help, especially for the students and the residents, and for a generation that think through these spiffy websites. I mean, it doesn't have to be a spiffy websiite, it doesn't have to be complex, but it needs to really clearly educate. And I would include rolling out on that website, and the position papers, things like videos that give a correct history of medicine; give a concept of health that is respectful. I think we can even tap into the diversity langauge, saying, "If you're going to accept diversity, accept me." But we know that the diversity language is a game. People don't really have a concern with diversity; they just want to silence voices that they can marginalize as not accepting a person.

There needs to be some sort of public display. Something public. I don't know what it is. I'm not for demonstrations or open air rallies in the current... I think that would be bad. I don't want masked Antifa coming after me. I do like Poland. How many know what Poland is doing? I just saw a press release, a little news blurb. Of course, it was in Russian... The Poles were calling for - on the history of the Battle of Lepanto. <Pause> Not enough of you smiled. Because, unfortunately, we've erased history. So, the Battle of Lepanto was the great victory of Christendom over Islam. Read G. K. Chesterton's wonderful poem on the conflict. It's politically incorrect, and banned, probably, in most schools... probably no one case. But on the anniversery of the Battle of Lepanto, the Poles have been called to go to the border of Poland and pray the Rosary. Because that's what the king did before the Battle of Lepanto. He said, "Pray the most holy Theotokos, the mother of God, that we have victory in battle." And that victory came. So, they go to the border, and pray for hope. That's beautiful! I'd even risk Antifa for that. We don't do the Rosary the same way {Orthodox - identifying?}, but it's similar.

So, can we start, and can we agree? I think so. We just have to have someone leading people, like academic people. We have to stop polishing our nuclear arsenal and let them fly. Which is what we do. I mean, we have the best battleships available, and aircraft carriers, and [a] nuclear arsenal, and we Christians an conservative people - probably because we're conservative, and we'd rather be at home, or working... conservative people - like Clint Eastwood said in that bizarre little thing he did with the stool - are conservative. They don't necessarily want to get out there and do things. But we often have the best arsenal to do it, we just don't have the courage to let them fly. So, I think we should start, when we can agree enough to move forward. What it's named - I don't think is as important anymore. What it's leadership is - I think it needs clear leadership. If it's multifaceted, one person can't do this, can't do that - it does need some faces - but it needs faces that aren't easily marginalized. Which is hard, honestly. IT needs a specific organization - I've already mentioned it - it must be an organization that explicitly keeps vision and leadership and control with God-fearing Christians. It needs a symbol. It needs trademarking. It needs initial educaiton materials that hit on both ?? {44:26} that are academically rigorous but also kind of the video that will go viral. And [it] needs language that's agreed upon, that is modest. So, this is the problem of trying to be relevant, and the risk of marginalization or being specific. I added ths while I was sitting there: natural law langauge;tThat dog don't hunt, y'all. Unless you're going to be in the ghetto of Roman Catholic thought, it just doesn't work well. In the quarters of academia, natural law's not accepted. I mean, one of the ethicists that worked for me {personal}, he was kicked out; he was encouraged to go to a different program to finish his Ph.D., because no one would support a natural law dissertation. It's respected in specific Roman Catholic and specific Protestant circles, and there's some kind of quasi-Orthodox positions that are similar, but I don't think a robust natural law language will accomplish the desire. Just like Cass' {45:34 name?} language - {Cass} didn't win. Natural law language and {Cassian} language has been around. It's been marginalized; it hasn't won. I vote for a much more bold, particular language of saying, "This is based on a Christian vision of a Hippocratic medicine. Others are welcome to join us, if you agree to the following modest proposals..." If you include gender reassignment, it ain't done. So, because there's such an active, violent reaction, I can tell you that health systems are getting probed for those cases. There would be any discrimination against someone seeking gender reassignment. They want cases. It hasn't happened as much since Trump has been elected. But, prior to that, it was fishy, it was obvious.

So, I think specific Christian language that doesn't call upon presuppositional {46:41 word?} reformed tradition, or a natural law Roman Catholic position, or a Gordon-Farr {personal} position, or a... I could go on and on and on, over kind of the different approaches to apologetics. I would say we just have a modest Christian language that states things as they are. Then, I think, there has to be a coalition for dissemination of ideas and progress. And this includes getting literature out there quickly. I mean, flooding. I encourage literature to be bold. Creating a literature, playing the same game, as the evidence-based people are, creating our own definitions of "health" and why they are not met. It is a resistance.

That's all I had to say.

Go ahead. We can have a discussion. Yes?

*** [47:40] Dr. Donna Harrison

So, question. Just in terms of structure - because, you know, are we talking as a separate orgainzation - all the different organizations say, "We're part of this," but then, how do you run it? How do you govern it? That kind of thing - I think as we move forward in thought we need to give a lot of thought to the legal... what kind of structure would work, to incorporate CMDA and AAPLOG and these pediatricians and everybody - how would we structure this so that everyobdy feels like they're winning?

*** [47:34] Dr. Ryan Nash

I suggest something that would be, maybe, akin to the American Board of Ethics for Specialties {47:38 name?}, where you have an umbrella group... I'm afraid, if any one organization took this on - I mean, I remember talking to Jane Oriten {48:48 name? details?} in December, saying, you know, AAPS, which I've known as the libertarian opt-out, the kind of gadfly in medicine that is pretty small and says specific political things... though I like {Jane}, I don't like commentaries {49:07 not sure}. She's great. But AAPS can't become this, and AAPLOG can't become this. None of the organizations... I mean, I thought maybe CMDA could - it's been around and it does a specific thing. It's more like Campus Crusade for Christ in medical schools. Let it be what it is. But use them in an organizational way instead of saying, "Hey, we're going to say that this is the Gospel and this is the theological correctness that we're going to have for students," let's say, "Hey, all you people that are interested in these concerns, let's get this information out." And you can keep your silo, but let's just have the silos coalesce in a big way-station, and let's get a train going through it, an dput some things on the train station - sorry, I'm a farmer; also, I live next to one of these silos now, it's really nice - so let's get some movement so it goes out of the silo, as well, and you can benefit from others. So, I would see [it] as an umbrella organization, but not having authority over those other organizations; being a standalone organization that invites dissemination, and one of its missions as an organization is to bring a coalition of partner organizations under it to help disseminate form and help disseminate information. I don't know if that works - legal...

*** [50:35] Dr. Donna Harrison

Yeah, I don't know. But I think that's part of what we should think about, because if you're going to form a website, you're going to seek grant funding so that we can actually do something, then you have to be something, you have to be legally incprorated; it has to say who's running it and all that kind of thing. So, in order to move ahead, I think you really need some infastructure, and I would like to move ahead like twenty years ago. I have a been in my bonnet to see this happen over the next few years. So, I just want to get some feedback about infastructure, and how it would work.

*** [51:09] Dr. Ryan Nash

I think you're right. I mean, two years is generous. I think that's about the time frame before we won't have an opportunity to do it. I would say that there may be mechanisms - I can't give legal advice - there may be mechanisms to get things started as the organization is being particularized - but I don't know the details of that.

*** [51:48] Dr. Michelle Cretella

Is there anyone here from the CMDA leadership? Because they have the Freedom to Care Coalition, which sounds similar to what you're describing. That might be one place to start.

*** [51:53] Dr. Donna Harrison

Freedom to Care sort of started as a coalition, but it's kind of under CMDA. It's a CMDA thing that other people can join. I think if we had an AAPLOG thing that other people can join, it would be mutual. So if we can structure it somehow that it's not any one of us, but we all feel like we all have equal say... you know, just something that everybody feels like they win.

*** [52:34] Joe{?}

I have some concern that you may be marginalizing us right from the start. Hippocrates was not Christian. Some of the early leaders in medicine were not Christian. Christ said, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations." So why are we circling the wagons and drawing into ourselves and saying that if you're not Christian, if you're not a believer in what Christ wants us to do, you don't belong in our organization at all?

*** [53:24] Dr. Ryan Nash

I didn't say that.

*** [52:26] Joe

Sounds like it. What's the base? You say the natural law is not accepted, but it is universal. The Ten Commandments, on the other hand, are often regarded these days by most of society as the Ten Suggestions. So, where is our foundation, if not in spreading the concept of the natural law, and that we are all, as the Chicago Declaration says, worthy human beings, and deserving of the best medical care? That we, as physicians, ought to be providing the best of medical care to whomever; and whoever we are, whatever religion we follow, as long as we follow the natural law. We need to make that acceptable, because I don't think we're ever going to get the Ten Commandments accepted universally.

*** [54:30] Dr. Michelle Cretella

Well, the Ten Commandments, the Decalogue, is part of the natural law, arguably.

*** [54:34] Dr. Ryan Nash

So, I never said that membership would be excluded. I'm saying that that discipleship that Christ called for changes reality; it changes the person; and I would only want in leadership those who are god-fearing Christians. That it may, in a functionalist way, be expanded to non-Christians and non-God-fearing Christians I think may be acceptable, and is a compromise I'm willing to make. Even though I think there's something distinct that could be Christian medicine, I'm not optimistic that we would find agreement in the context of the United States [about] what [that] is. As for the natural law, there's a whole history of philosophy that challenges natural law. Most of those challenges are more accepted in the secular society than natural law [s]. There are a lot of religious groups that don't accept natural law, including Orthodox Christianity, fundamentalist Protestants, [and] presuppositionalist Reformed. That we define nature [as] fallen is a challenge of the natural law. There's a penchant of natural law theorists to say something, to state something that they assume is self-evident. It's not self-evident to those that are not formed by the same rules of evidence, by the same authority of God, by the same understanding, and the rites and rituals of the people. I understand that there's a long tradition of Roman Catholics and some Protestants furthering a natural law theory so they become relevant in a secular world, I just don't buy that it's been very successful. And I can't sign off on anything that's natural law. I can't. I CAN sign off on {56:31 ??} language that said, "We define health as being the furthering of this..." If you [add], "...by evidence," "...by the natural law," I have to say, why can't we stop the theory just a couple words earlier? Then it becomes far more inclusive of Christians that may say, "I've read natural law philosophers that further all kinds of evil, according to their natural law. I want to know what God says. What's God say? That's it. Done. I don't need to explain it philosophically." So, that's my concern about using specific natural law language. I think [among certain] groups, academic organizations, that that language is very safe, and people know what is meant by it. But outside of that circle, I don't think [it]'s as helpful. I would argue for much more modest language, that doesn't call upon - it calls upon a loose Hippocratic tradition. Hippocrates was not Christian, but there was a very known, very tangible Hippocratic Christian tradition. I do nthink there are differences between the Hippocratic Jewish, Islamic, and non-Hippocratic traditions. That's why I am suggesting that somewhere the organization make a comment that it's informed by the Christian Hippocratic tradition. Now, it can allow, it can have as an outpouring of that, people that want to sign off on whatever profession that is made. I think that's fine.

*** [58:19] Cara

I'll be very quick. My name is Cara {personal}, I'm a resident, and I started Conscience in Residency, which is an organization {58:27 ??} Missouri. We have a flashy website, we make flashy videos, and I've networked with several dozen medical students and residents, helping to do these things and find programs and be safe. I'm happy to help. [That's] point number one. My point number two is, just with a medical students, we'll have to be careful about how we help them with events, because a lot of them are very isolated; they move through their years very quickly; it might be easier to help them do events in {58:51 ??} model. But I'm happy to help in whatever way I can, figuring out ways to do things with students and with {58:58 ??}.

*** [58:59] Dr. Ryan Nash

I think {59:00 ??} has been very good. I haven't paid much attention outside of {59:04 ??}, the national organization gives the formation for debate, helps organize it. That way, students just kind of help pick a topic and get experience. They have a national conference at the beginning of the year to train the student leadership. I'm impressed by this organization. I've met the leadership of it. I think they may be natural partners, and a good model. I think even more... saying we have far specific aims than {59:40 ??}. I think they may be a good partner. Thank you.

** transcript 3 (draft 1)
*** [00:00] Dr. Donna Harrison

Dr. Ruppersberger is a member of the American Association of Pro-Life OB/GYNs, and we've been in conversation for a long time about the topic of training and certification and survival of doctors who want to train and to practise without killing their patients. So, please welcome Dr. Lester Ruppersberger.

*** [01:13] Dr. Lester Ruppersberger

So, I'm not exactly sure why I am here. My two claims to infamy are, one: that I am board certified, and I did serve on the certification board DO OB/GYN {01:26 NSA DO} college for five years back in the 1980s and early 1990s, and two: {Donna} asked me.

So, as I was preparing this, I thought that there are probably more ways than one to skin a cat, so, what I am going to present to you is kind of a take off of a little story that I heard one time.

A very righteous man died and went to Heaven and got to the pearly gates, and Saint Peter was there and said, "You lived a very good life, and you can get into Heaven today, but you have to answer three questions." He said, "Oh, I didn't know that I would have to take a test. I'm not prepared. I didn't know. I've never heard of anything like that." [The] first question was: "Name the two days of the week that begin with the letter 'T'". And he said, "Oh, that's easy: 'today' and 'tomorrow'". And Saint Peter said, "Well, that's not exactly what I was thinking of, but it fits the bill." So, he said, "The second question is: how many seconds in the year are there?" And he said, "Oh, twelve." Saint Peter said, "Twelve??" "You know: January second, February second, March second..." Saint Peter said, "Well, okay, that kind of fits the bill, and answers the question. The third one's a little bit more difficult: What's God's name?" He says, "Oh, it's Howard." "Howard?? How did you come up with Howard??" He said, "You know: 'Our father who art in Heaven, Howard be thy name...'"

So, we're looking at - as I summarize this - do we want to start a new board, or do we want a new designation, or do we want a new society? And you already heard a little bit about what that society is. So, I'm going to give you a little bit of history about what we currently have. The American Board of Medical Specialties consists of 24 boards. They were all founded by their respective specialties, and their purpose was to assess and certify doctors who demonstrate clinical judgment skills and attitudes that are essential for the delivering of excellent patient care. So far, so good. And, the member boards answer boards answer the public call to establish uniform standards for physicians to achieve and maintain board certification. They're NOT membership societies. So, if we're going to form a board, we have to kind of... I'm a realist and a pragmatist; I don't want to re-invent the wheel, and I'll mention some things in relationship to some of the comments that Ryan made at the end, because I didn't get a chance to make a comment. Since I have the podium, I can make the comment. We need to think about, do we want to start all over again, do we want to mirror something else that already exists, or just exactly what [do] we want to do?

All the current boards are physician-led, they're not for profit, and they're independent evaluation organizations that all have accountability to the profession and the public. Their governing bodies are all salaried employees of the boards, and they each comprise specialists that are qualified in many fields, each comprising representatives from among national specialty organizations, even in related fields - so as an OB/GYN, we've now diversified into uro-gynecology and maternal fetal medicine and GYN oncology. So all of those people are on the board for OBGYN.

<indistinct question>

*** [05:06] Dr. Lester Ruppersberger

They focus on constant education, and so, as was mentioned a few times already, education is a key. And part of that education need sto be an education of the public, because the public's not even aware of what board certification means in relationship to most of what we do. And these groups - the American Board of Medical Specialties - do participate in national initiatives on innovations on healthcare delivery. So, in other words, they're involved in politics. And so, they have a lobby, they are in Washington, they spend a lot of money, they have a lot of money they're influencing, and lobbying politicans to make things happen. Board certifications started in 1917. There was a total of 24 by 2002. There was a response to the {05:56 ??} in 1910, that helped distinguish physicians who were trained by apprenticeship, and those that had a more formal scientific training. It's different than the Royal Colleges in the UK and Canada. Their boards are all part of societies, and ours are not. They're independent of membership societies, and it is important to set high standards to the public. The American Board of Internal Medicine came about in 1936 and was put together by a coalition of the AMA and the ACP. The true constituency is the public, who desire transparency and accountability. And so, that's who you really have to answer to. There is an underlying theme that I'll talk about in a few minutes. It was originally voluntary, but now it is considered to be mandatory. It was originally considered to be a mark of excellence, an extra professional achievement, and I think if we be focussed on the excellence part and the professional achievement part, and take bits and pieces from some of these things that are already out there, that it would stead {07:08 ?} us well in what it is that we want to do.

Board certification evolved from a consumer movement in healthcare, but as I said, most of the public doesn't know what it means. They don't know the difference between board-certified and non-board-certified. They don't look at your diplomas on your wall. Your certification - if you have only one, like me - is framed. Well, you don't have [it] in every room in your office, you just have it in one place. It really grew tremendously as a result of hospital-based medicine and the need for more technical care. [It] led to credentials where hospitals needed to have some sort of criteria to evaluate and decide whether or not they were going to give you privileges.

So, recertification began in 1972. So it's not all that old, but it's old enough. I happen to be one of the people that is "grandfathered," which may be another reason why I was asked to talk about certification. Anyone that was certified before 1994 got grandfathered in and didn't have to go through the maintenance recertification process to become recertified.

All the boards now agree on MoC (Maintenance of Certification), which requires that your certification is limited to 6-10 year cycles, and they have four elements that are necessary for that recertification: that you had an active, unrestricted license where you practise; that you have enough self-evaluation of knowledge and increase in strength and standards for continuing medical education, including the ability to demonstrate significant learning; that you have a secure closed-book examination of knowledge; and the last thing that they added, which is the newest one and the most controversial one, the one that everybody is trying to go against, is the assessment of performance and practise. Because they're actually going to take the results and the outcomes of your treatment of your patients from your electronic medical records and make a decision as to whether or not your care is resulting in better outcomes. And so, in the future, your maintenance of certification will be co-dependant on that.

The American Board of Internal Medicine has just one of those 24 boards, and I singled them out because most of that information was readily avilable on the internet. They use their own tools, called PINs (Practise Improvement Modules), which are internet-based, and they are related to national guidelines, and information is sent from the physician's office to the ABIM on a secure link to be analyzed. And so, part of the electronic medical records system is that your practise, performance, and your outcomes - and that's irrespective of whether or not your patients are complying - and irrespective of complications which occur even if you practise the best medicine in the world - bad things happen - and so, they're gonna look at your outcomes, and make a determination without having the details, other than what you've put into the record. So, it's no longer discretionary, and consumers and payers - mostly payers - are increasingly interested in evidence of your competence and [the] quality of care that you provide. And now, almost everywhere you go, hospital privileges are dependent on your board certification, and even residents that are coming out of residency training - that are coming on a staff at the hospital as a new associate for a group - have a specific, limited period of time before they become board-certified, or their privileges are rescinded. And so they get temporary hospital privilges, at least in Philadelphia area.

Originally, and [still] for some people, perpetual motivation is still the primary driver for certification. However, there's a lot of criticism of the process that's been going on, because the amount of time that it takes and the amount of money that it costs to get recertified. And the important thing that I outlined here in red is that these boards have absolutely no regulatory or legal status. It's all perception. They've created a perception which is going to be an onerous task for us to overcome. But they do impact the marketplace, and that's where the payers come in. And we'll hear a little bit more about some of the payment issues a little bit later. So, originally, [their] value was an important initial step in professional development. But, as practices change over time, there's going to be a need to understand these changes, and overlapping scopes of practice among different specialties. So, we're talking about different models of healthcare now; we're talking about home-based healthcare, we're talking about using physician extenders... and so, all those things are going to complicate the issue of those that are just in the office practicing medicine one-on-one with their patients and don't use eletronic medical records. I happen[ed] to be one of seven partners in my practice when I left and I was so dead-set against the electronic medical records - [it] was only being mandated by medicare; we didn't have to do it. So what if they cut our medicare? An OB/GYN practise - it was only 5% of our income. And so, it was an irrelevancy to me. But, for the three and a half years that I was tortured with it, for three different systems, it didn't improve my care at all, and it ticked off a lot of people, and it ticked me off. Because, I was answering emails at eleven o'clock at night, with patient questions coming through the patient portal, that I used to get paid for when they came into the office with the same complaints.!!!

So, we need to build better relationships. The importance of patients is to build relationships, and so that's an important aspect that we need to look at if we're going to go forward with forming a new board. We need to have sensitivity to their needs and concerns. What is it that the consumer wants? Because this was originally consumer-driven. I don't know how much impact we can have as far as the payers are concerned. And, there's gonna be different integrated systems of care that are going to come up in the future, and where can we fit into those systems of care? I've noticed in my area - I guess it's one of the last areas in the country, the northeast - it's like herding cats with physicians. Very few people are owned by hospitals. But more and more private practices are being purchased by the hospital. One particular hospital I work at, St. Mary's Medical Center {personal}, 80% of the primary care practises in the Bucks County area that serves about 400,000 people were purchased by the hospital. And the reason why they were purchasing primary care practices is because now they own the HMO; they own the lives. And so, they can direct where they go and where they're capitated and where they need to go for X-ray[s] and lab[s] and things like that. And so, the hospital gets all that feeding back into it. They only own one specialty practise, one OB/GYN practise. And there's 23 OBGYNs in the department. One of my friends is an OB/GYN in Cleveland, and he just gave up his practice to become a laborist at Cleveland Clinic, and he makes a better salary and benefits than he did when he was in private practise working three 12 hour shifts a week. And so, it's very attractive as one gets older and [is] looking at retirement. And so, we have to buck that trend a little bit, and that's one of the forces that are going against us. You all know what criteria are necessary for certification. You go to [a] medical school; serve a 3-5 year residency that is an approved, accreditted program, by another accrediting organization that says your residency is approved; you have to get letters of attestation from the program director; get a nonrestrictive license; and pass a written and oral examination. When I was in the DO certifying board, I actually had to go out around the country, because we examined people and observed them doing surgery. And we had to certify them. They had to do a hysterectomy and one other major surgery. Two examiners went in, and the applicant had to pay for the airfare and the transportation accomidations for the examiners to come in. And they have all of their charts available, and medical records pulled, and categorized by diagnosis and procedure. And then make sure that you had enough cases on the OR. When you went to the OR, we watched them do the surgery, and could tell whether or not they were doing a good job, and then we went back to the board and voted on whether or not they were going to be certified. In addition to the written and the oral [exams]. They've since done away with the practical exam. So. It sounds like it was a little ridiculous, but it was the system at the time.

So, some of the obstacles, if we form this new certifying board, are that we're going to be competing with long-standing, well-recognized organizations, that are well-recognized, at least professionally; we're going to compete with already-existing boards that are that have approved residencies, competency testing, recognition by the major organizations, and big lobbies, and control all of the money and all the strings; and we're going to compete at a hospital level with standards for privileges. So, to establish this new organization, we would need... As all of you obviously know, if you're going to practice, you need an office, a staff, financing, a board of governance, and committees to establish standards; you would need marketing, as you've heard, for physicians, and the public, and hospitals; [you would need] a website and a market presence; and you would need to establish yourself, to give credibility with insurance companies. Uou may not immediately be paid, depending on where you are and what kind of insurances exist. And who knows how it's going to change in the near future, depending on what happens.

We also are competing against the redefinition of the Hippocratic Oath. We call ourselves a society of Hippocratic medicine; there are people that are going to turn around and say, "Well, you know, the Hippocratic Oath has been changed by so many schools that only 8% of the medical schools in the United States actually take the original Hippocratic Oath. The other schools take the Osteopathic Oath. Some people take the Oath of Maimonides. Some people take - 33% of the schools take the {18:14 joke?}... Some take the Declaration of Geneva. And more than half use a modified version." So, we use this word, "Hippocratic"; WE all know what it means, and WE all know what it intends and portends, but out there in the culture, where people are looking at, you know, this school sa[ys] it's okay to give up {18:42 ??}, and this one says it's not, and this one [doesn't] even take that oath... So, we really need to think about whether or not we want to use that word. I was kind of against it in December, and then I kind of got for it, a little bit, when I was thinking about it; but now I'm not so sure. So, I just think that we really need to think - not for a real long period [of] time, but we really need to think hard about what it is that we want to call this organizaiton. We're going against a body that's 80 years old, that has 37 specialties, 86 sub-specialties. There are 860,000 active certified physicians in the United States, and 520,000 of them are currently engaged in maintenance of certification. Only 13% of all physicians in the United States are not board-certified and could give a flying hoot. There was an article recently in one of our local journals about an 83 year old founding physician in upstate Pennsylvania who was the only doctor in town who's having her license looked upon by the State of Pennsylvania, because she doesn't have electronic medical record, she doesn't participate with any insurance company... She charges $50 for an office visit. She does holistic medicine. Rverybody loves her. Nobody hates her. She's board certified in family medicine but she doesn't pay her dues and she doesn't get recertified, and so Pennsylvania's going to take her license away. Not because she's old! She'd have a good discrimination suit if... So, I don't know what she's going to do. But these are the threats and some of the obstacles that we're going to face.

I took one example [from] the American Board of Internal Medicine, and their financial numbers from 2016: They had an income of $62.5 million. 54% of that was for certification, and 45% of it was for maintenance of certification. And 1% was for "other". So, you can see the breakdown there. And they spend 18% of that $62 million to develop the exam. And I think any computer can do that in a relatively short period of time with a database of medicine from medical schools and internships and residencies and things like that. But, be that as it may, you can see that physician support - a lot of this goes to salaries.

So, with the new consideration, do we want a new certification? Do we want to be diplomats of another organization? Or, do we want a new society? Do we want to be the American Board of Medical Ethics? Or, do we want to be the American Board of Ethical Medicine? Is that different than Hippocratic medicine? So, as was mentioned, we need a name, mission statement, purpose statement, vision statement, and a definition of standards. And, again, I'm not against reinventing the wheel. {Donna} asked the question. I have to say I was listening to {Ryan}, [and] this is kind of my interjection. There are bits and pieces of all the things that {Ryan} mentioned in all of the other organizations that he listed. Catholic Medical Association, of which I'm the past president - we have a student section. We have 260 medical students from around the country. We have a resident section with 180 residents. And they have their own websites, and their own Google Hangouts, and their own reporting systems. And we have a mentoring system where they can hook up on their electives with authentically Catholic positions in any specialty. So, if they have to do an EMT rotation, or a family medicine rotation, we have a list of the names of all the physicians that are willing to take students in their office and mentor them, and they can go live with them for the month, so they're not only housed, but they share their families and their family life and their social life, and go to church with them, that they can go to the office and the hospital with them. Every year we have a boot camp [at] Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia, with about 30, 40 students that come in on scholarship, and they get one week of immersion in authentic Catholic healthcare in almost every specialty from specialist[s] traveling from around the country on their own dime to give them that. I had a meeting in March of this year with the new dean of the newest Catholic medical school - Saint Paul University, the 6th Catholic medical school in the United States to open - and asked her about her curriculum; what it is that we could do. I'm going to mention in a couple of minutes some things that the CMDA does. I had a meeting with Dave Stevens {personal?} down there two years ago when I was the president.

So, I think putting together the leaders of all of those organizations in one room - not a big room, like this, but if you have 12 organizations, 12 of those leaders, that know the history and know the workings of all those organizations, and had a list of needs, and say, "We have one of those. We can use that." "We have one of THOSE. We can use THAT."... Another model that I can mention [regarding] how this is going to work, [is] the CMA: We have the national organization, but we have 101 guilds. And each of them are their own 501.(c)(3), and they function in their own particular area, but they all filter back up and feed up and are members of the national organization. So, we give them the mission statement, we give them the vision statement, we give them the logo, we give them the documents, we give them the guild documents to get their guild started. They have to have their own physicians, they have to do their own fund-raising. So, if this big umbrella organization could bring in all these other organizations, like CMDA, CMA, AAPS, and all these others that have like-mind and like-spirit, you would get 20 or 30 or 40 thousand potential members immediately, without them changing their parent organizations. They can still be their own independent functional organizations, but contribute with whatever pieces of that puzzle that you're looking for that you need to put together to have that big coalition, to bring everybody together. Kind of like the United States government, only {25:00 indistinct} states, but a little bit happier and getting along a little bit better.

We need an application process. We need a certificate process, marketing, we need somebody to review all that, we need to create that process. I thought, well maybe we'll call it the society of ethical medicine, and after your MD or your DO you can have the letters SEM and you can sign your certificate and you'd be a member of the society of ethical medicine, and people would ask you, what is that society, what do they do, and don't the other doctors practise ethical medicine? Well, not the way that WE practise ethical medicine! And let me tell you about it. I had the same issue in my practise, but I converted my practise - I was, you know, a fully contracepting OBGYN, a Roman Catholic, but then 20 years ago I had a conversion, through a experience with a Catholic priest, I won't bore you with the details, and I converted my practise {25:55 indistinct} and people would come in and say, well what's natural family planning? What's NFP? And I would say, well, I can teach you, do you wanna hear about it, do you want to know about? And I had stuff all over the office. And I had the initials after my name. Certified natural family instructor. So, people would ask. So, something like that may bring some, you know, close market.

!!!

There are a couple of alternatives that I found in my research - one of them is the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons, committed to providing certification that ensures physician compliance with national standards and promote life-long learning. It's $169 a year, it's a 15-minute application. They currently have 6000 diplomats. They are becoming recognized by multiple hospitals throughout the United States, and it is an up-and-coming and growing alternative, already in existence, to the certification process, and they're already being recognized by some insurance companies throughout the country. Prior to the formation of this organization, which just came into existence in 2014, there was some controversy surrounding the requirements for continued certification in medical specialty, and a lot of the things that were being proposed at that time by the APMS - practise assessment, patient safety activities, really did not provide optimal use of physicians' time. And was no quality data - talk about evidence-based medicine - there was absolutely no quality data at all that justifies these activities for maintenance of certification - the amount of money, the amount of time that's involved. And, so they feel that they have the metrics to provide, that would satisfy and justify requirements for maintaining their hospital staff privileges.

In January 2014 the American Board of Maternal Medicine changed its certification policies for physicians, so now, instead of being listed as board-certified, you're listed as certified meeting maintenance of certification requirements, or certified NOT meeting maintenance of certification requirements. And so there's an ongoing engagement in various knowledge practise assessment and patient safety activities, that's assessed every 2 years, and there was an article in the New Englang journal of medicine, in January 2015, by Paul Tearson, who is the founder of the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons, who said, his personal frustration in trying to fulfill the new MOC requirements ultimately led me to create a web-based petition that now has more than 19,000 anti-MOC signatures, and contains thousands of comments against the new MOC requirements. You can see the website if you're interested. A recent second petition with 6000 signatures advocates taking a pledge of noncompliance with the requirements. So there's a whole other group of physicians out there that are not coming from where we're coming from, but are not happy with their certification requirements. So they can come into the boat. When you were talking about Christ, and talking about you know, all the groups of different peoples that he was talking to, the Jewish people, the Gentiles, and the Samaritans, and they were all coming into the fold from everywhere, because they were moved by his charisma and what he had to say. So it's really gonna be about what we have to say. 

In addition to the national board of physicians and surgeons, there is an American Academy of Medical Ethics, and I took this right from their website - this is chaired by Dave Stevens, who is the CEO of CNBA. Shame that nobody's here from that organization. But their mission is to promote the interest of medical educators, medical practitioners, and scientists, the care and wellbeing of patients, the protection of public health, and the betterment of the medical profession. As well as to protect and promote the historical values that have provided the long-standing foundation of/for Western healthcare. And the {revision? mission} is that we foresee a standard of healthcare in North American being once again defined by the Hippocratic tradition. Sound familiar? Sound like something that we have been talking about? So, physicians - and this is part of their mission statement, on their website - physicians must respect all human life and must not intentionally take life, that is, must not take the life of the unborn, and must not perform euthenasia, and must not provide assistance for suicide. What we do, we serve patients, healthcare professionals and our culture by serving as an ethical voice to speak to the government. We {} church and public on ethical issues facing healthcare. We offer resources that you can educate yourself and others on important isssues affecting healthcare professionals and patients. We said we needed literature, we needed white papers, we needed information, we needed educational handouts... we fight against the legalization of physician-assisted suicide through grassroots efforts in states across the country. We arrange and conduct educational conferences, speeches, interviews, and research into fields of ethics, medicine, and science. We teach traditional values through scholarly endeavours, and we network healthcare professionals who share these values. And to quote Dave Stevens, "Education is the key to understanding and without it truth is compromised. Experience has shown us how quickly legalized and assisted suicide becomes euthenasia, where a physician not only writes the prescription for the lethal drugs, but administers them. Within four years after Washington state legalized physician assisted suicide, a Washington lawyer began pushing for euthenasia, for those who were not terminally ill - which shows how danger legalizing physician assisted suicide really is. The American Association of Medical Ethics has a state director in every state of the 50 states of the united states, all {??}. And so if you go on this website, and look, you can see who the state director is in your individual state, he may be somebody you know and you can contact them and talk about it.

These are their values. We subscribe to the traditional values of the Hippocratic Oath, which include the practise of medicine involving covenants with deity, patients, students, teachers, and colleagues. And notice that they capitalize the word "deity" but do not specifically mention the deity. Which is not the Greek gods and not any other gods, but a Deity. Kind of have the open window to interpret that if you are of a belief other than Christian. Physicians must be trustworthy, they must always seek their patients' best interests, they must not exploit their patients or caregivers, they must practise within their capabilities, they must practise the standard of card, they must respect all human life and must not intentionally take life, they must maintain confidentiality, they must seek justice and avoid injustice and discrimination, and they must be accountable for their actions. And they have a pretty spiffy website. And so all this is already put together in there.

Recently, a Texas hospital physician staff voted at their medical staff meeting to remove the maintenance of certification requirements, and the hospital denied that vote. And took it away and said, Nope, you can't do away with that, we're gonna keep on using it, if you wanna keep your privileges then you have to go through whatever {} they say. So, as a result of that, two MD respresentatives in the House introduced a bill to prevent Texas medical board from using MOC as a requirement for obtaining and renewing a medical license. Ultimately, beyond privileges, and beyond payment, our licenses come from the state. They come from an organization, they don't come from a board, they don't come from the federal government, they come from the state. And so, whether you want to be politically involved or not, if it comes down to a point where they have enough clout from the other organizations to impact what's going on in states, then they can make new licensure requirements that will impact your potential to get relicensed. And I don't know - I tried to research - I don't know that there's any other alternative to licensing. Certification, certainly, but licensing... you know, you go to {far?} medical schools {...} you still have to get licensed, and each individual state.

The MOC takes physicians away from patient care, it costts time, it costs money, there are many objections to the process, there's a lack of clinical relevance, there's a lack of evidence that shows that it impacts the outcome of healthcare, there are fees - the average cost is $1846, the highest was $3000, for the American Association of Allergists and Immunologists, and the cheapest was $985. There are 14 boards out of the 24 that require an oral, closed-book exam, and a mean cost for that is $1694. Who are we making rich? Between the cost of your license, the cost of running a practise, the cost of malpractise insurance, the cost of your association and your professional organizations, as a DO, I was required to maintain my board certification to be a member of the ALA and PLMA - Pennsylvania Osteopathic Medical Association. They were requirements to maintain my board certification. So I had to pay the $800 a year to the national organization, whether I agreed with them or not, and I had to pay the $600 to the {} state organization, whether I agree d with them or not. If I wanted to keep my board certification. There's 22,000 physicians that have already signed a petition to recall MOC, and some people, some physicians and healthcare professionals are looking for a society maintaince {?}, and so that may be part of this formation of the new society, potentially, rather than a new board - and, as I mentioned, there are no differences in quality outcomes among MOC compared to those with time-unlimited certificates. So, if you get grandfathered in, I could practise in a state equal with all of my partners who are getting recertified every six to ten years, I could run circles around them in the OR with surgery and techniques and things that they never saw, and never heard of and never knew, and provided excellent quality care, and just getting my CMEs over here, cuz you have to get that to maintain your requirements.

So, wrapping up, John Patrick is a professor in Ottawa, I heard him at the Canadian Christian Medical and Dental Society 2 years ago when I went up there and represented our organization when they were fighting the battle against euthenasia and physician-assisted suicide, and a quote that I took from him is, "We must talk about the necessity of transcendence. How a commitment to the sanctity of life to train with moral ethos, and to the critical importance of the preservation of the moral integrity of the physician, even over illegitimate claims that patient autonomy if medicine and the doctor-patient relationship are to be preserved." And that, I think, is the focus and the direction that we need to emphasize. There are many writers that have compared our times to the sack of Rome. Alistar Mcintire said, "And if tradition of virtues was able to survive the horrors of the last dark ages, we are not entirely without grounds for hope. This time, however, the barbarians are not waiting beyond the frontiers. They have already been governing us for some time. And it's our lack of consciousness of this that constitutes part of our predicament. We are not waiting for Godot. But for another {???} St. Benedict. as was the Rev. {???}.

So, will qualifying bodies accept what we do? That remains to be seen. The value of the new option to me is {} completely unclear, because I'm not sure what hospitals and insurers are going to do. Dr. Stone in his interview in the New England Journal of Medicine article mentioned that this is a grassroots movement that will grow in acceptance relatively rapidly, and he stated that because of the widespread outpouring of support, we received an alternative of MOC {??} that now is the time. And so there are a bunch of other physicians who for various and different reasons that may be willing to look at alternative... as I mentioned, there were 20,000 physicians that have signed the online petition.

There was some cautions, however, that if we switch, we have to be careful - {39:39 name?} an internist at Northshore University health system in Glenvue Illinois, and a clinical assoiate professor of medicine at University of Chicago told Medscape medical news that if we're gonna look at an alternative medical certification, we should look before we leap. He applauds the new board - that means the national board of physicians and surgeons plan, but he says it will not pass scrutiny under the current Affordable Care Act. It will not pass scrutiny under Medicare. So you may lose affiliation if you go in a different direction, unless we kind of nail that down. He explains his reasoning in a recent blog post: unless it contains all those pieces outlined by APMS, and they're the ones that outlined it in the current healthcare act, it will not be a legal entity. Until we change the law, any subsequent board that tries to replace the current system is not likely to succeed. Personally, after passing his MOC recertification three times, he's not going to pursue a 4th time after his current tenure ten-year runs out. He doesn't think the current proposal is a reliable alternative.

So for discussion: do we form a committee to develop an outline based on what we're presenting here today, come up with some specific things that was mentioned by Ryan and Farr, in our previous talks, in three months or six months with some documents? How are we going to get funding? My son's an MBA in pharmaceutical finance and management, and he introduced me to the SWOT analysis. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. And so, the strength of the current system is that it complies with all the current laws. The weakness is that it's costly and time-consuming and agenda-driven and non-pro-Life. The opportunity for us is that we can create a new system, or a document, or a society, or pledge - start out small and go bigger - start out with the nuclear bombs and drop them all over, as was previously mentioned - you know, creates a mini mass annihilation of the current system - and the threat is that we could lose our privileges, we could lose some income, we may even lose our license. And we live under a threat.

So, I'll end there and, I don't know if I can entertain any questions.

*** [42:12] Dr. Donna Harrison

Let's take one question, and then we'll break, and people can talk to you during the break.

*** [42:18] Dr. Lester Ruppersberger

I have nothing more to add. <laughter> I don't have an answer for it. I mean, as I said, I'm a pragmatist. I'll reinvent the wheel - I've been involved in an orginzation for the past 15 years, on their board, and I see bits and pieces from AAPLOG that I've stolen and took over and ACPedes that I've stolen and taken over, and I just think that the pieces are out there and somebody needs to put them all together and put them into - funnel them up into an institution, maybe base it out a medical school, sit down with some faculty members that already has credibility, that already has academics, that already has a faculty, that already has certification, that already has some other things that we need to go with it, and then go and run it from there.

*** [43:04] Dr. Donna Harrison

If I could just add two things: I did talk to the director of ... before December 3rd last year I talked to the director of NBPAS, and he is not pro-Life, but he said, you know, we don't have any agenda other than good medicine, and we are happy to act as an umbrella organization, and allowed for certification. And I said, look, our issue is, are you ever going to require assisted suicide, abortion, other kinds of things, he said, no, we're never going to require that. So, I want you to know that. And I did - we have communication with CMDA, it's just they have so many activities that they weren't able to come to Dec. 3rd or this meeting, and the other things is, the National Board of Medical Ethics, I think is under CMDA. So, again, it would be an issue of sort of structuring it - I know they've got - it's a great organization - but it is under CMDA.

But we can take one question, and then we should break, so that they can clear the dishes...

*** [44:19] man

If anybody has any doubts about any of this, {let them be said}, from 1972 until now, all these boards had the opportunity to prove the worth of recertification. They are scientific organizations! They have staff! They could have done this. They did not. And they did not because, they probably knew that they'd never be able to prove that it did any good. And in fact, recent studies say - as you pointed out - it doesn't do any good. If anybody is concerned about the financial wellbeing of these organizations, I would recommend that they go and watch some guidestar {??} and look up the IRS form 990, and I can tell you, I don't know OBGYN, I can go pediatric. Pediatric - the American Board of Pediatrics has over $40m in the bank. They have a beautiful office in North Carolina, filled with expensive artwork and furniture. They lavish meals and trips and things on their boards that we could never consider. Their past CEO took home over a million dollars a year. Now, there may be some people in OBGYN that take home over a million dollars a year - there's nobody in pediatrics...

<general laughter>

*** [45:57] Dr. Lester Ruppersberger

I can assure you, nobody in OBGYN - the malpractise is $900,000.

<more laughter>

*** [46:03] man

So, you know, this is an organization I wish we had started, that we'd all be having all the executive staff that we need, being able to have meetings in exotic places, and not worry about the financing of any of it. And, on professional organizations, at least in pediatrics, lost/lock step with the board, even if they're not part of the board. They provide education so that you can succeed in the LMC. And, with that, they're making a great deal of money, to the point where the American Academy of Pediatrics this year has a profit of over $4m.

Well, I can - my only response to that is I went down and had a personal meeting with Dave Stevens from CMDA, because I wanted to see how an organization had 17,000 members and a $10m a year budget, and they moved their offices from Texas to Bristol, TN - now I don't know if you've been to Bristol, TN, but there's really nothing in Bristol, TN - and they started out on the upper floor of a pharmaceutical warehouse that stored drugs, and he had developed a personal friendship with that particular individual that owned that pharmaceutical warehouse, and he gave him the space. And he started out - he was in family medicine and his executive vice president is an OBGYN and they met in the medical mission field in Kenya, and they worked together for about twenty years in the medical mission fields in Africa, and then they came back to the United States and decided to become part of this organization - and he went out and got his MBA - he's the president and CEO, so there is no like, big, - the Catholic Medical Association, I have to sit down on a board of 19 people and argue with things for ever and ever and ever, you can just imagine 19 Catholics in a room arguing over medicine and what to do about the organization. So, and he said that they had an ER doc from Texas that donated a million dollars to them, 100,000 a year for ten years - it was specifically to go to one of the 33 missions they do in 25 countries around the world. And so they have an organizational setup - they have a magazine, they have a national conference, they have websites, they have all kinds of teaching and everything, in fact - we get our CMEs for our programs from them, because we can't get them from other secular hospital systems and educational organizations, because we're the Catholic Medical Associatin, so a lot of our talks have to do with spiritual aspects of medicine and healthcare, and wholeness of the person, and integrity of the person, and things like that - but we just had our meeting in Denver three weeks ago, we had record attendance of 705 attendees. And so there is a hunger, there is a need, and I think the point was made earlier that now may be the time, because there is a rumbling, and there's a lot of disruption, there's a rage, there's an anger, there's a sentiment, and we do outnumber the barbarians at the gate. We really do. But we just can't be satisfied with staying at home and living in our little worlds that we've create that are safe and comfortable.... my wife said to me, you're retired, why are you going to Chicago again? - as the president of the CMA. I said because they want me to talk about certification. What do you know about certification? <laughter> I said, not the {} but I can talk.

Thank you.

So I am so excited to be at this meeting. Before I start talking about direct primary care, I just wanted to share briefly about my personal professional experiences that make this conference seem so urgent to me.

So, after residency, that was 8 years ago, I joined a really prominent pediatric group in town that I thought I would fit in great, and I thought that everyone was like-minded, because almost everyone professed Christianity. But I soon found that my just basic Biblical beliefs about sexuality and the value of life were not gonna be tolerated. And I tried to be very sweet and pleasant and I was not obnoxious in any way, but I had a lot of pressure. So, for years I was advised just on the side by a very helpful lawyer from Liberty Counsel - tried to just kind of reason with everyone, like, these are my personal beliefs, you know, if there's some way that I am going against evidence-based medicine, please show me. I tried to reason over time, like, look, I've encountered, you know, the pregnant teenager; I've encountered teenagers who are struggling with their sexuality, and nobodoy's complained. You know, I've dealed with people sensitively, I'm not judgmental, and it was just a lot of pressure over the years but I was just trying to stick it out there. Then, at the beginning of last year, in our state through the school system the transgender bathroom issue came up. And it pretty much came to a hysterical point that I was part of ACPedes and ACPedes had submitted a letter saying why that was not in the best interest of school children. Then a few months later, a group of all the prominent pediatric offices in town just kind of out of nowhere said we want to support a ban on conversion therapy and if anyone doesn't agree, they need to speak up, or else we're gonna just say that we're all in agreement with it. So, Michelle Cretella helped me write a very respectful letter, just laying out the reasons why there's no scientific basis to exclude choice and therapy for sexuality issues. And a few days later, I was in the job market again, even though I thought I was pretty secure, because I was a partner.

So, I was - had a few weeks of my life really learning just to trust God - I was really surprised that I was pretty much just shunned [by] the whole pediatric community after that letter that I wrote. So after a few weeks, God just in a really awesome way connected me with Dr. Wu, and with the CEO of Christian Healthcare Centers, which - Dr. Wu's gonna talk about in a few minutes - but, I remember talking to Mark Blocker, the CEO, and he said, "God put this on my heart years ago, to make a refuge for medical professionals" - which definitely made me cry, to know that God had a plan and a way that I could keep practising medicine and didn't have to leave my home town.

So, transitioning to, what is direct primary care? So, this is a model of medicine in which patients pay a membership fee to cover a scope of medical services. So, as it says in the name, usually it's talking about primary care, although some people use this DPC word in relation to specialists, and there's an increasing number of specialists operating by this kind of model. The average price across the country is $75 a month per membership, and this is an alternative system to the fee-for-service insurance billing model. Some people have called it concierge medicine for the masses because it usually is affordable to middle class families. So, the membership fee is usally paid directly by the patient, although some employers will pay this or offer it as an option for a patient, for their employees. In this type of model, physicians are working directly for their patients, not the insurance companies. So it's kind of - our CEO talks about it being like, Amazon, Netflix, or Uber. You cut down your overhead by taking out the middle man. And it's rapidly growing in the US. In 2005, there were only 146 DC physicians, and now - there's a lot of different statistics, but it's at least thousands of DPC physicians across the US. Here's an example just of one website that DPC offices can register on for free, and this shows 786 DPC offices across the nation, and the only states that I'm not aware of offices in are the Dakotas.

There are 21 states who have favorable laws for direct primary care. Thankfully for us, Michigan is a really good state to do direct primary care in. Oregon is the only one that there's a lot of restrictions. If you go to a website called DPCfrontier.com which is made by a DPC doctor who's also a lawyer, he has it so you can just click on each state to see what the status, legally is in your state.

So, as far as the benefits, we chose direct primary care for Christain Healthcare Centers mainly because of the additional time we gained by being third-party-free. So, the funding the often a source of control and manipulation. So, in the majority of the mechanisms, the government uses to dictate how physicians practise medicine are tied to payment. Also, direct primary care removes the conflict of interest that is so rampant with insurance incentives and other things involved with other-payer system, and allows physicians just to focus on what is best for the patient sitting in front of you, without being distracted by all of the quality measures and all of the documentation or other requirements that the third-payers want you to do.

So, most DPC offices feel that they can get better patient care and one reason is because the patient panels are often a third to a half of what a doctor would have on a traditional third-payer office. And again, the main reason is because you're cutting out the middle man. That means you can have longer visit times, our visits are typically 30-60 minutes, and that's much more conducive to relationship-building, and to really having that time to address your patients' spirit, soul, and body.

Another big benefit to us of direct primary care as just financial stewardships as Christians - practising medicine is much cheaper without insurance being involved. Nationwide, about 40% of office revenue typically goes to insurance-related expenses, as Jeff will talk about more - a lot of Primary Care offices have labs and medications as part of the membership, and it has just blown our minds away - when you take insurance out how much cheaper the labs and medications are - it's often a tiny fraction of what it would be if you were paying for it through a third-payer system. And as a lot of other direct primary care offices have done, we've negotiated rates for specialist services, for advanced testing, and lots of other benefits to patients to help keep cost down.

A DPC office is an especially great financial fit for patients who have a healthcare sharing ministry - so that's the biggest proportion of our members, a this point - and one reason Jeff will talk about more of Samaritan Ministries helping us - but there's about one million Americans who have have a health sharing ministry as their alternative for insurance. It's also a good financial fit for people with high deductible insurances, which is now what 29% of American employees have. And people that have no healthcare coverage otherwise.

Donna had asked me to just talk about some of the challenges, so, it can be really difficult to talk to people and try to help them understand - like there is life outside of insurance - like there's different ways to do this. Most people who have the healthsharing ministries, they tend to get it - like homeschool families who already kind of tend to think outside the box, they're a lot of our patients who will get something like this a little easier. Another current challenge is you can't use HSA dollars to pay for membership fees. But, there is proposed legislation right now - we hope that will change because that will be a huge draw. And, the startup of a new office is of course financially challenging, especially if you don't have that insurance reimbursement coming in. And, kind of a sad part is if you're already in practise and you transition to direct primary care, a lot of your patients don't often follow like the national average is like 4-6% of patients that follow you. Some doctors will have a hybrid office where they'll take insurance from some patients, and then other patients pay a membership fee, or they'll transition with/like that for a few years.

And I had to stick my adorable daughter in here - the best part of direct primary care for me is more freedom, especially where we have a very price-focused office, and having more time with my patients.

*** [10:39] speaker 2, Jeff Wu

Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, to ... time to talk.

My name is Jeff Wu. I am an internist - I've been in practise for 11 years now over in Grand Rapids Michigan. I left a real and outstanding group - I didn't have the same experience as... we were considered to be {??} medical office in west Michigan, but... we were convicted that there was a malaise and parasitic cancer in the healthcare industry.

We created Christian Healthcare Centers not as a reaction to the Affordable Care Act, but rather, as a reaction to the way third party interests were manipulating and, dare I say, prostituting healthcare. We know there needs to be a change, we know that the current system's not sustainable, and we needed to come up with a different healthcare delivery model that could be sustainable, and had other significant advantages along the way.

We are a not-for-profit organization. We are mission driven. And fortunately I can actually blow through these slides because it seems like the people in this room share our mission. We are focused on providing excellent quality of care - I['ll] go into the definition of exceptional in a little bit. The way that third party payer systems - CMS, for profit - as well not-for-profit insurers view quality, they determine quality now based upon numeraical, quantifiable data. There is not real subjective qualifiable aspect, at least if you're talking in terms of reimbursement, which let's be fair here, is the reason why we had/have ECQ wham {??}, which is why we have PQRS - well, HAD PQRS. We are biblically based. So quality for us is defined based upon the way that Christ delivered in the New Testament, and the way we were told to provide care in the Old Testament. It's pretty straightforward. The standards that we follow, in terms of the ethics in how we practise healthcare, is determined biblically.

Applicable {?} healthcare. What does that mean? It doesn't just mean that it's affordable to everybody. People keep thinking about patient autonomy. Are we able to provide services that they choose to accept? I would argue that with the new technology that we're developing in healthcare with the consumerist attitude toward the healthcare product, if you will, unfortunately, patients are now feeling justified in demanding services that, morally, a Christian indiavidual may not consider to be appropriate, or, culturally, is inconsistent with our values.

Operational values - speaking of which - Dr. Curlin's article actually kind of mirrors our own. We are a Christ-centered organization. We are committed to quality as defined by the patient and by God. We are a definitely, unabashedly, life-affirming organization. We were actually very heavily criticized by Christian organizations in Grand Rapids because we chose to put the word "Christian" at the front of our title. They said that we were creating an undue unecessary target for ourselves, subject to attack. I believe in the Holy Spirit. I believe that if were are truly making this His organization, I think we should give God some room for grace to work. So, we labelled ourselves the Christian healthcare centers very deliberately.

We are committed not just to our own membership, but to the community as a whole. We have been given a mission to be stewards of all of God's creation, not just our fellow believers. So we are committed to public health, we are committed to public education, - and we'll go a little bit more into that as to why we chose our corporate structure the way we did. We are faith healers in that we believe that God is in fact the great physician. However, we are absolutely committed to outstanding quality of care as defined by our respective boards of specialty. We are a multi-specialty group, we intend to expand out even further to multiple subspecialties, but we do practise evidence-based medicine - we are committed to outstanding quality of care not just well, holistic care of naturalism, which reeks of animism, but I don't want to get into that discussion - we are holistic - {??} the word holistic - we are are whole-person focused. We all know that the body, the flesh, is the first thing that gets put to death, which is why the care that we provide is focused also to tailoring itself toward emotive care, and spiritual care.

We are a 501.c3 not-for-profit tax-exempt organization and the reason why we spend literally a year debating, should we be for profit, not for profit, but for the reasons of charity and religion we opted obviously to be not for profit. The advantage of being a religious not for profit is we can act as a {?} organization, which fits with our mission and our values. We wanna be able to provide care for the indigent, for the underserved, and obviously being a religiously exempt organization allows us to do so and remain mission-oriented. It also allows us to provide community-based education, however, as a religious organization we can filter in the education that we provide to the public with a - what we would consider to be a moral appropriate more values-driven and Christian alligned perspective.

Now a lot of you are probably sniggering at the next bullet point - legal protection. You know, precedent has been established. You know, we have Catholic, Jewish, Baptist hospitals - there's been a lot of pioneering work done by the Christian community throughout the history of the United States, in healthcare, and at least for now, the government affords us some protection, either through precedent established historically, or by the fact that we are a 501.3c. We all know that special interest organizations, the government itself, is daily trying to destroy that protection that we're afforded, but for now, we wanna try to take advantage of that to the best we can.

We are a charitable organization because we believe that we are to be charitable with how we regard our fellow man. Right now, again, just like in the religion, nomenclature, we are a decidedly committed organization towards caring for the indigent. We have set aside 10% of revenues to care for those who are underserved, indigent etc... currently 3% of our membership do not pay for their membership. 7% of our members receive financial assistance - we basically use the same criteria that a lot of other organizations would do - we basically index it to 200% of federal poverty level.

The real advantage, however, of being a not for profit, is that we have a board that keeps us mission focused. Rather than being a for-profit organization, - it's not about saving money. You could structure your for-profit clinic as a PLC and LLC and you can shelter all that profitability by redistributing it to your providers. It's not about tax evasion or trying to avoid having to pay taxes, it's more about what are we doing with our business? What is it that we corporately want to accomplish with the resources that God gives to us? And being a not for profit organization allows us to exercise better stewardship, and use those resources for mission based purposes, but it also gives us an opportunity, as {?} described earlier, - how to start, a direct primary care office, when you live and you die on your membership? James here from Samaritan Ministries knows very well, through {?} his gift to us, we were able to - and through the gifts of others - to capitalize ourselves {for} start up in ways that for profit organizations cannot.

Brief review. Bekah's already described some of the advantage of being a DPC, I just went over the advantages of being a not for profit, being a not for profit allows us to be mission focused, grants us some legal protection and provides some foundation for us to move forward in a not for profit healthcare model. Capitalization stewardship opportunities that aren't afforded to other organizations with a different business model. Direct primary care, again if the mission is to preserve independence and allow us to practise according to our values, financial independence removes moral conflict of interest. Allows us to preserve the mission, allows us to practise our craft the way that God has intended us to do so. Busy slide - I apoligize - you don't have to read it all - we spent a lot of time on this. This began out of discussion where we were lamenting the state of affairs in healthcare. Again, not exactly a reaction to the Affordable Care Act, however, we did know that we needed to create something that was novel, but most importantly, self-sustaining. There are several not for profit Christian clinics out there in the community that provide indigent care, that live and die based upon charitable givings. And while that's outstanding - that's great - we wanted something that didn't just provide care to the indigent, but care for all of God's people. We didn't want to create a flash in the pan that died when our benevolent donors decided to move on, or,... move on. Which can happen. Obviously.

So, we spent over a year debating, how are we going to create the foundation, the business model for our practise? And ultimately, we decided, not only a not for profit, but direct primary care. Once we decided to do direct primary care, it was pretty remarkable how quickly things accelerated. Within six months, about two months ahead of schedule, our lawyers had told us that there were no not for profit religiously affiliated direct primary care offices as of november 2013. Because of that, we were quite worried that we would encounter just tremendous amounts of opposition from the IRS in giving us our 501.3c designation. They - praise the Lord - actually gave us approval about two months ahead of schedule. Which, the moment that happened, as you can see placed on the timeline, we were incorporated and then we created our board almost immediately after. We were very specific at who we chose for our board membership. We didn't just try to target affluent individuals in the community who could help to finance and payroll our operations - we were very specific about selecting individuals who were either prominent in either legislation, the judiciary system, or who have been in the healthcare industry long enough to give us some guidance on how to navigate the malaise that is the executive and corporate aspects of healthcare. We identified our first clinic - and once we found our location, that's really when we start putting our feet on the gas and selecting our actual clinical staff. and it took us probably about 18 months to find three physicians - we rejected about three times as many. That's not to say that these physicians weren't outstanding physicians. But our commitment isn't just to get doctors in the house to provide quality healthcare, we want to make sure that the care that we provide is missionally driven. And you'd be amazed at house surprisingly difficult it was to find people who were truly committed to the mission. And I'll get into a little bit into that a little while later. 

About a year later, after we identified the location, we were actually able to open our office - we started with about a 150 patients. Well, what is it that we provide? $80 a month and you receive everything on this list. Everything in the parentheses are {?} here. For example, for laboratory services, we provide all the routine lab services - I don't want to get into a debate as to whether or not routine lab services are even warranted - but, if we do them, we cover them. However, we don't just say, I'm {} gonna check your CVC and TSH, but if you want that T4 you gotta pay out of pocket. We actually negotiate with labcore to where we get between 50 and 75 percent off their entire library. Yeah. And why would they be willing to do that? Because we as an institution will go into a double financial risk for all the labs that we ordered. So, we pay for everything, and our patients reimburse us for anything that's not included in membership.

Medications. Any drug less than $10 a month we include as part of our membership. So what about that 80 year old individual who - if you look at statistics - on average is on 10 medications a day? How can you pay $100 - unless they {} $10 a month - how can you pay $100 a month {} membership when this Medicaid individual only pays $860 a year? Well the answer to that question is actually quite - oh by the way, our lawyer also said that we're the only healthcare institution they could identify that actually charged less for people as they got older. Scripturally speaking, I think we have a commitment to the elders. They are the ones who brought us into this world and raised us. We feel morally we have to have a commitment to them as well. Which is why we actually charge less for elders - actually, anybody over the age of 60. So...

We don't just stop with what exists within our four walls. We have also basically undertaken upon ourselves the responsibility of pre-negotiating rates like an insurance organization would on behalf of patients. So we are going out weekly, talking to different organizations, different subspecialists, allied health providers, service providers as well, to basically get - our initial negotiations start at Medicare rates. Now, you might say, why don't you do Medicaid rates? Well, because we wanna have good working relationships with people. That being said, we need this not only to be equitable for our patients, we need this to be equitable for our fellow providers. So Medicare is a great starting point. Kimmy briefly talked about micro economy at the end, but what we're trying to do here is not just create bargains for our pateints; we're trying to create a micro economy for providers to operate independent of the current system.

Things that are pending. This is actually almost in a chronological type of order - we're currently powerfunding our diagnostic ultrasound - as we intend to bring on OB into our practise - I think we ordered one that's like $38,000 I'm not sure - and we crowdfunded it and in about 6 weeks we got $24,000, was the last count. And there's apparently another donor matching what we got, so we actually may be above... Fitness, nutrition. We are about wellness. We are about treating the whole individual. I personally believe obesity and hypoglycemia might be the greatest threat to national security. And therefore we need to be very deliberate about how we address that. Lifestyle modification. We're bringing on health coaching. Massage therapy - we actaully kind of already have in place, but we haven't implemented it yet. Home care services. Keep people in their homes. We are actually networking churches and healthcare providers - nurses, MAs, etc. - who already are wanting to volunteer and simply lack a mechanism of being able to do so, through an organization that can provide and coordinate care throughout the community. We can't do this as a for profit organization. We can't technically do it as a charity. But we can do it as a para-church organization. And we're in the process of developing that infastructure right now.

General surgery. We're actually about 2 years ahead of schedule and general surgery. Dr. V-- coached us after he found out about our organization, basically saying, I don't know how we're gonna do it, but we need to figure out how I can work for your organization. Not everybody needs surgery, so putting a surgeon on staff for a few thousand people, probably not going to be able to justify a salary, so what we've had to do, we've kind of had to innovate a fee schedule, which is why last week I was over at {} Hospital {} our operations officer basically negotiating preferred rates for surgeries. Talking with advanced radiology for radiographic services. Talking with physical therapy. Talking with anesthesiology. No, I cannot, unfortunately, bundle payment for everything. But I can do the legwork so that when the patient has to interface with the healthcare system, we can provide them with an inputs that makes it look like a {} payment.

Again, we needed to make it equitable for everybody, which is why currently, we're projecting that we're going to provide on average 60% savings {} cost of services. That $50,000 knee replacement that you need, how does $24,000 sound. Now, you might have to pay out of pocket for that, but, we don't have any control over how our patients insure themselves, but I will tell you that James will be quite happy to know that his organization gets to save itself $26,000 for a knee surgery, because their patients are taking advantage of the relationship that we're creating. {} microeconomy. {}

Financial stewardship. How can we possibly make this work with 17 employees? 3 physicians, 2 midlevel physician extenders, chiropracter, clinical psychologist, a bunch of nurses - the remaining staff are an executive team, advancement team, front desk. The way we do it is, we recognize that there's gonna be social sacrifice. We intentionally selected individuals who were mission fit and we basically pegged in our bylaws that income is gonna be stapled to the 50th percentile of the national average.

We are committed to being good stewards of our own employees. Part time or full time, all of our employees are given Samaritan Ministries membership. Them and their families. Basically, we try to take very good care of our employees. We're not gonna reimburse them exhorbitantly, but we do want to be good stewards of our employees. How can we afford to do it? 572 patients per physician. The national average for a patient count for primary care, particularly family practise, is 2300. 2200? Somewhere around there? You need 572 patients for the organization to be solvent. That's pretty awesome. However, the advantage of being a not for profit is we have an advancement team that goes around to various organizations and donors to try and acquire for us charitable contributions for operational expenses. We also have a marketing team, and actually the first thing we did when we - probably about two and a half years before we even opened, is we actually hired on [a] marketing stategy team that helped us with branding. And our primary demographics that we're trying to focus on are small businesses, small business Christian individuals who want to be good stewards of their employees but can't afford to put a quarter of their net revenues towards what? Paying for healthcare coverage. So you either provide healthcare for your employee, or you give them a 2-3% raise. It's tough. We're trying to create an easier avenue to provide better stewardship for their employees at a far more affordable rate. Obviously, targeting churches, as well as fiscal conservatives, moral conservatives, political conservatives... we've been advertising in front of Hannity radio in our region, a bunch of Christian radio stations have been giving us free airtime, which has been pretty amazing. The day after Labor Day we had 21 people, 22 people sign up in one day. And it's because that's the weekend that we started our radio campaign. We actually had Ken Bot perform what's called a {viability} study. Y'all are probably asking how can we create a fiscally independent organization that's viable? Well, this is how. The viability study that he performed is called a bot analytical model. It's basically the model that they use to evaluate solvency for organizations. They look at financial stewardship, corporate structure, assets, so on and so forth - it's the model that they use for banks to determine if something is worth investing it. Well, technically we don't have anything to put up as collateral, so we couldn't take a loan, but we still took a study and gave it to our donors to show that the we that we have designed our organization is efficient. We have greater than a 99 - according to his stuff; I didn't make this up - according to his study we have a greater than 99% probability of being viable, profitable, solvent, at five years. That's not saying that it's gonna TAKE us five years to get there, that's saying, in five years, we'll still be around. And in fact, this $1.8m project - the 1.8 is really not just firsrt annual cost for startups - it's actually how much money we project it will take to get us profitable, which is about a year and a half. Annual operational costs are gonna be around $1.4m. We are projected to be profitable by October 2018. We've been open for 3 months. I don't know of many for profit organizations that are profitable in a year and a half. So.

Right now, we have 500 some patients. We've more than tripled our numbers in less than that many months. Which is pretty good. But obviously {complications} isn't quite enough to make payroll. So, we had our advancement team out there - not quite $900,000 - currently, this year, we're trying to raise in charitable givings, our chief Financial Officers currently predict that we're gonna acquire just over half - oh I'm sorry, just over a third of that - about 2/5s of that. To date, we only have $27,000 in loans. And all of that $27,000 is from the three {} myself, who started the organization. We just needed some start up capital to hire a lawyer to do the research to help us get started.

So how are we making it work right now? Half of us aren't getting paid. Which is why it was vitally important to find physicians who are here because of the mission, not because they're hoping that DVC will pad their pockets. So, there are obstacles. Absolutely. And I dare to find the people who you would choose to start the organization is of vital importance.

Future plans - I already described services that we're pobably gonna be adding in the next year to three years, we are expecting to expand out to other regions - currently we have fifteen cities across the United States asking us to plant clinics. Currently - this is a little throw out to James, here - currently Peoria is our next target city. For very good reasons. We are currently doing our due diligence on an $8.7m facility, through which we can perform all sorts of procedures. We're trying to get our organization started first, but Dr. V-- is kind of pushing us and is introducing us to individuals who may make that a reality sooner than we expected by about 2 years. We've even explored the possibility of creating senior living environments. The regulations regarding skilled nursing facilities and even assisted living facilities are difficult for us to navigate, but in terms of senior living resident homes, and independent living, we're hoping we can provide those sorts of living environments for people who would choose to share our values. We wanna create an equitable living environment for those people. We have hoped thus far that maybe in 8 to 10 years we could {} starting our own medical school that would allow Christian medical education to continue existing. Because we all know that Christian medical ethics is under threat.

I'm a macroscopic type of guy. Main area of interest in healthcare is actually ethics and technology in ethics, so broad picture interpretation, what is our plan? Reclaim the healthcare experience for our patients. Unfortunately, the quantification of healthcare, all the analytics that go into it, are overly objectifying what should be a qualifyable experience. We are being turned into {} managers rather than true patient care providers. Our goal is to restore the relationship that should exist in healthcare. We're trying to redefine what is quality. Quality isn't defined by patient expectation, quality isn't defined by social pressure. Quality is defined by God, and that which constitutes humanity. We want our patients to define what is their quality, and to be quite honest, let's be fair/clear: what is quality to our patients? What's quality of life? Being able to enjoy relationships, with people whom they love. So the care that we provide is tailored to the body and facilitating love. I know that sounds really emotive but that's not what...

However, what we're trying to eliminate is the moral conflict of interest and financial conflict of interest that's introduced by third party payer systems, and the government, so, direct primary care - not for profit has facilitated that evolution so to speak. We are currently trying to establish a microeconomy where all aspects of healthcare can operate independent of third party payer systems. This is not intended to be a west Michigan phenomenon. This is intended to be a vehicle that we extend to the rest of the nation. We want there to be a micro economy where people can choose to opt out of the traditional healthcare delivery model - and we call it traditional - it's actually kind of a misnomer, cuz it's only been since 1964. Barely three generations. Right? Really what we're doing is we're turning back to the way healthcare was originally delivered. So, we want to restore healthcare to what it was, and make it equitable for everybody to do so. And - actually, I made this slide before I realized who my audience was, but - our true objective - we want spiritual revival in our country. We want cultural revival in our country. We need people - secular, religious alike, to recognize that the postmodernists distortion and mutilation of what has for two millenia been fairly concrete in terms of quality, is being defaced. And if we corporately don't create an environment where we combat the effects of the fall, well... I would rather that Christ have less work to do when He comes.

Questions?

*** [38:08] Q1

I was asking Bekah about the vaccine situation. She told me that 95% of your kids are on vaccines for children which you cannot have catastrophic - if you have any insurance that technically would cover vaccines, then the kids don't apply for the *NC program.

*** [38:31] Jeff Wu

That's true.

*** [38:33] Q1

So, how do you work the thing as far as, I'm assuming, you know, patients may need catastrophic healthcare, you know, they end up having to be hospitalized or whatever, yet how do yo work it with getting vaccine for them?

*** [38:57] speaker 1

So, we've been paying attention to what our patient demographics are - who actually comes. And I - so far, most of my patients are health sharing ministry families, so it hasn't been an issue at all.

*** [39:12] Q1

Cuz they don't pay for vaccines, I imagine.

*** [39:14] speaker 1

Right, so they qualify for BFC. And then for the other insurance companies, I've just gotten really agitated like, like, who can go to our local health department which actually is really close to us, what ages can go to {Rite Aid?}, just can go to Walgreens, and {?} whatever the prices there, so we'll talk about the vaccines at the visit, and then they can go. But really that's been a small percentage of almost all the vaccines hae been given right in our office.

*** [39:44] Jeff Wu

For adult vaccines, we organizationally are committed to providing outstanding quality care as defined by our specialties, therefore we are compliant with the immunization schedule for adults, and we include those in membership.

*** [40:00] Q2

I know... many medications can't - unfortunately in that $10 range - probably one of the more expensive aspects of medical care for our patients - {} relationships with pharmacies, you'll have those cards that send off all the time, is that a {} those for the patients, you don't have insurance that covers medicine, or what?

*** [40:19] Jeff Wu

Gorex {?} - I wouldn't say we exclusively use Gorex, but we use Gorex for all of our uninsured or non Medicare part D individuals, we still can provide tremendous cost savings to our patients through our distributor - we actually use a wholesale distributor just like any pharmacy would - to obtain our medications, we just don't upmark the cost of medications. So anything over $10 they pay, but we provide them with literature which shows how much savings we afford them. If we can't get it cheaper than another provider in the community, we refer them, or we send a prescription to that facility.

*** [40:57:] Speaker 1

And we can get a lot of medicines for under $10. We have most of the things you need for common issues at under $10.

*** [00:07] Dr. Donna Harrison

The next person I'd like to introduce is James Lansbury - and James, please forgive me, beacuse I didn't prepare your bio ahead of time. So if you could give an introduction - you're the lawyer, legal person for Samaritan Ministries...

*** [00:29] James Lansbury

So, Donna asked me to kind of set up the stage a little bit around reimbursements for healthcare. The - my name's James Lansbury, I'm the executive vice president for Samaritan Ministries - we are a healthcare sharing ministry, and as much as I really enjoy Franklin {??} shoeboxes, we don't have anything to do with that - so, don't say thank you for that. The - we wanna get - dig down into this issue of how we've gotten to where we go, but I do want to talk a long time because I think we really could use some time to interact with each other. But, as we sat here today, we've got {}, we've talked about, Hippocratic medical society, training, credentialing, practise - and all of these things fitting together, they're really one thing. For us. As we look at the consumer of the healthcare goods, which is the patients. And that's the people that I work for. Because Samaritan Ministries members are among many of your patients in the healthcare world. And so - I like to use baseball season - I am a baseball nerd - and so, if you're not a baseball fan or a baseball nerd, I'll apologize if I use an illustration in that way - baseball doesn't work if there's only five people on the field. You'll lose. The ball is almost impossible to stop. We have really good hitters in major league baseball today, and they'll be able to find the hole in that. Now, six people, you're probably still gonna lose. Seven people, you may have a little bit of a chance. But really you need all nine players on the field. There needs to be a pitcher and there needs to be a catcher. There needs to be three people in the outfield. There needs to be someone at first base to catch the ball so that you can get the guy out. As we look at the healthcare field that you're in - the healthcare sphere, the healthcare panorama that we're living in right now, we have to look at this the same way that a good baseball manager looks at fielding his team. We have to look at this as if all of this is one thing, because if any of the pieces that we've talked about today - training, credentialing, practise, reimbursement - if any of those are lacking, this doesn't work. We're not gonna to fix anything. And I know we talked - and Dr. Nash has been - it's good to see you again - I {?} with Dr. Nash, I'm not Orthodox though

*** [02:58] Dr. Ryan Nash

Not yet!

<general laughter>

*** [03:01] James Lansbury

But I'm also not un-Orthodox. But the idea {?} can't tell, is that okay? So, the big deal here is that we have to think about this a little differently. Christians, for a long time, we've been harping around in our country for a seat at the table. And see, we're looking at it backwards. Cuz it's our table. Jesus Christ owns the table. We sit at it already. And so, to look at this as if we have something to prove, and that we have something to do to interject ourselves, because, I can tell you that if we started a medical school and we ran it by Christian principles, it will be the best medical school in the country within 20 years. If we start an accreditation system for physicians, within 20 years it will be the only one that anyone cares about. Because none of you got into medicine because you wanted to get rich. Christians don't go into medicine because they want to get rich, especially if they've studied economics. Christians get into medicine because they care about people. Christians get into medicine because they read the parable about the Samaritan, and they want to go and do likewise. And so we don't have to be concerned about how this fits together, but we have to get out there and do something about it. We have to stop sitting around and say that their system is the one that works, because it doesn't. We have to look at it from a perspective of, our job, as Christians in this field, is to look people in the eye and figure out what they need and how we can deliver it to them. And certainly as professionals, you need to be expect to be paid for the service that you provide for people. You need to be able to expect that within a fair market that you'll be able to make a living at what you do. But I can tell you that if I came to any of your offices, I don't care if you have malpractise insurance. Because I've read 1 Corinthians 6, and if I have a problem with you, there's a way for us to handle that. And it's not in the courts. If I come to your office, I don't really care where you went to medical school. I care if the patient that I talk to - that - talked to me before I went in there, got the kind of service that they want. And if there's Christians in the medical industry, we are able to police ourselves with our own certification, it will be better than anything the world has to offer. Because we care if the patient dies. We care if the person walks out of your office with a smile on their face. We care about that. And because you care about that, you're gonna be different.

And so, I don't have time to do all the work that needs to be done, that Dr. Nash was talking about up here, and the others have been doing that - but I don't have to do all that, and neither do you. And that's the big thing that we need to see here; is that Satan wants you to believe that there's more work to do than can be done. And see, that's the genius of the parable of the Samaritan, is that Jesus doesn't say at the end of the parable, Go fix poverty. He saids, help the guy in the ditch. See, Satan makes it big. He makes it seem impossible. And so somewhere along the way, we in this nation - Christians in this nation - started to believe that the federal government had unlimited funds and that Jesus was broke. And when I say it this way, you laugh. You laugh because, we know the federal government does not have unlimited funds; printing presses notwithstanding. And we know that God does. Why are we acting like it's not true? Because we're believing in lies. And so Donna asked me to set the stage for what healthcaring sharing ministries should be looking for for reimbursement. If you folks are no longer credentialed by any of the standard licensing agencies. And I can tell you, that from Samaritan Ministries standpoint, we don't care. If our member trusts you enough to come and see you, then we want you to get paid. And so our guidelines aren't gonna change at all. I know some of the other healthcare sharing ministries use all kind of changes, and there's different ways that they approach it - MediShare uses a network that you have to belong to - we don't have any of that because we don't like it. Because we think the patient and the doctor are the important people here. Our organization exists to coordinate people bearing one another's burdens. Now you'll note that our organization therefore does not exist to make decisions about what treatment people should choose. Now we don't share 100% of the treatment, I know someone mentioned vaccinations, we don't share routine care, and there's a reason for that. It's because patients need to be able to think about what care costs. The reason healthcare is expensive isn't because you guys are overcharging for it. It's because there's no marketplace left. There's no engagement around cost and benefit analysis. Why do we still do colonoscopies? Why has there not been someone who figured out a less uncomfortable way to accomplish that? It's because they get paid $1500 for them. And there isn't any other option. And there's no reason to have another option for it because the patient doesn't care because he's not paying for it. Now, I know some of you are scientists, and I'm not, I'm an economist. And so, and I have both hands, - sorry, if you're not familiar with the Eisenhower joke there, we'll explain that one later - but, the idea being that the patient needs to be engaged in the picture - the patient needs to see how much you charge. And he needs to be able to actually argue about it. You shouldn't be signing contracts with insurance companies to figure out how much you're gonna charge them for things. You should be talking to your patients. And that's the brilliance of the Christian healthcare centers, that they're thinking about a direct relationship with the patients - that's the brilliance of what APS is doing, is that they're thinking about how to engage patients around the picture.

You guys spend all of your time and a huge amount - more than half of your overhead - in general - filing paperwork with the government and with insurance companies. When you want to be talking to patients. And so, to make a living, you've got to spend 5, 6 minutes with the patient when you know you'd really like to spend 20 or 25. You're accepting money from Medicaid because you don't think that there's any way that you could make it without it. And I think it's time to fix that. And Samaritan Ministries is one little piece of that. But the big deal here is that we have to throw the doors open. We've gotta shine the light on it. Because the marketplace works. Economics is very simple. And we live in a country where, when the free market works, it produces wealth. That was the brilliance of the Austrian innovation - is to understand that economics is not a zero sum game. In that, when you provide something for me, and I pay you for the services that you provided, that both of us win - there's no winning or losing in a free financial transaction. Both the buyer and the seller win. There is no person taking advantage of someone else. When I give you something, and you give me something back, we both got what we wanted, for less than we were willing to part with. That's the beauty of it. And so if your patients don't know how much money their insurance company is paying you for what they do, how do you expect them to value it properly? How do you expect them to see what brilliance and beauty that you're producing in their lives, as you share Christ's love for them, through your service and your vocation, and the gifts that you share? And what Samaritan Ministries allows, because we ask you to print up a paper bill, so they can see it and send it to us - though we're working on a way to do it electronically, {} soon - is that they allow you to be transparent with your patient. For them to appreciate you by paying that bill and for you to have that transaction along with them. And if we're gonna win this, if we're gonna see real change in healthcare, it's gonna have to be back to that point where the patient cares about you and you care about the patient, and the insurance company can go off and jump in a lake. And I know that sounds scary. And all of this sounds scary. And that's the great part about it. is... we don't have to be afraid. I think, if I remember correctly, 365 times in the Bible, the words "fear not" appear - 365, that number sounds familiar. That's the number of days in a year! That God puts, for every single day of the year, God says, once, to you, Don't be afraid. So when you wake up tomorrow, there's another {way}. Because He is there and see, when Dr. Nash stands up here and says, he believes Jesus changes everything, that was the most important thing he said. Jesus changes everything. Shadrach Meshach and Abednego are standing there, in front of a furnace that they're about to be tossed into, and what do they say? "God's able to save us from the furnace. And even if he doesn't, we don't care. Cuz we're not gonna bow down to your idle." When David comes out, and he sees the people cowering in the foxholes, and Goliath taunting God, he doesn't say, "uh, that guy's pretty big." No, he says, Who is this heathen Philistine that dares defy the armies of the living God? And see, we are, friends, brothers, sisters, we are the army of the living God. Five stones and a sling is all we need.

So, I'm gonna wrap up here, because I want us to talk. I want us to engage around - not just the issue of reimbursement, but everything that we've done through today. What are the next steps that we can see to encourage one another? I'm willing to answer any questions you have about Samaritan Ministries and how we work, but let's not walk away from here today with a spirit of fear. Let's not walk away from here with a spirit of uncertainty. Let's walk away from here today with a spirit of surety that the God who began a work in each one of us is gonna complete that, and that He has a plan that encompasses all of us, and all we need to do is walk in it. Because - and it's gonna work. Now, it might work painfully, you know, there's lions and tigers and bears, and colisseums, that exist, and I can't tell you for sure which age we live in. But I can tell you that I don't wanna be the person who doesn't deserve to be thrown into the colisseum because nobody knew that I was in love with Jesus. And I don't think you do either.

So let's talk.

*** [16:11] Q1

You saw that there were roughly a million Americans in health savings ministries - I have a handful of close friends, including my brother, who have been a part of these - uniformly they have dramatically better than other arrangements they've been a part of before - what keeps that number from being five million, ten million? ... Howard, from Duke University, and my co-pay is $250 a month, it covers my entire family, you know {}...

*** [16:48] James Lansbury

One of the things that we know is that employer-provided insurance is gonna be here for a little while. K, one of the - and I will speak positively occasionally about healthacare reform - one of the things that the Affordable Care Act could have accomplished, especially if they'd dropped the emloyer mandate, is they could have moved us away from an employer-centered system. And that is probably the lynchpin in our healthcare problems, is that employer-provided system, where if you buy insurance through your employer, that you save literally 30% in taxes off the first 10% of your AGI because you can't deduct it any other way. And so you're saving your payroll taxes, you're saving your federal income tax, whereas if a self-employed person or a person who's buying insurance from Edna, an agent down the street, they're gonna pay a tax on that, until the cost gets above 10% of their income. And they're gonna pay payroll taxes on it either way. Which is patently ridiculous, by the way. But it's what we backed into. I mean it's a really awful tax {?} benefit, and there's the only tax increase that I can personally support would be taxing insurance benefits and letting people deal with it, and level the playing field. And - so I don't know how to get around that, but I do know that for a lot of our members they're choosing not to participate in their employer benefit plans because they want their dollars to be going to someplace that doesn't do abortions. They want their dollars to go to someplace where they can be in control of it. They don't want to be stuck in a network with the employer-paid plan. They wanna be able to engage doctors that they want. They wanna choose a direct primary care physician - those are choice that we have to make, but when your employer provides it, it's very difficult to get around it, and of course, the Affordable Care Act doubled down on that employer problem with the mandate where - people are afraid to drop their program, because $2000 per person per year is not cheap - you know it's, for big employers, not awful, it's not quite as bad as the $36,500 per employee per year if you offer a bad plan, which is another - yeah, it's - I don't know if anyone ever did the math for you, but that was the really weird thing about the Hobby Lobby case - if you offer no insurance to your employees, the fine is $2000 per employee per year. If you offer great insurance that doesn't include birth control, the fine is $36,500 per employee per year. So they were being punished for offering something that offered 99% of what they were supposed to do. And so, yeah. This is {...}

*** [19:31] Q2

I was very impressed when I visited Samaritan Ministries - I thank you for what you do - when I hear about {??} and about the direct primary care, and when I listen to AEPS things, I come away often with the same questions, because the focus often is on primary care outperson services, for a generally, relatively healthy population, where most of my career has been spent in the ICUs of academic medical centers and cancer centers. So, in one way, I see that there has been a micro economy formed, and even micro micro economies, but they take advantage of the larger economy in - of healthcare kind of safety nets, the cancer care centers that will not deny patients, - so the populations I'm wondering about are - the provision of in-patient, expensive - we spend most of our dollars - we over-utilize hospitals, we over-utilize ICUs, but we still utilize them - these programs, how do they impact kind of in-patient, expensive care, the outlier, hepititis cases, and then the patients with chronic illness - I think of, you know, I have close friends that have down syndrome daughters that both have Her{?} Disease, and have to go down to the GI specialist every month. If they have that kind of plan, it's very expensive.

*** [21:21] James Lansbury

Well that depends. And so, the chronic care and preventative care are two different things. So we want to separate those out. And so, if you went and got a test - for Samaritan Ministries - you got a test because you turned 45 - which I know all of you are about to do soon - and so, you got a test just because you turn 45 - we don't share that test, it's preventative, just a routine type{} - but if they discovered something, because - at that point you have symptoms - we do share your test at that point, which is the opposite of what the Affordable Care Act does, which is, it moves you from preventative care, which is 100% covered, to diagnostic test, which is now subject to your deductible, which means that you thought that you were getting your $1200 test for free, and now you're paying $1200 for it. Which is always fun, if you're a patient, I'm sure. So, we do have members with chronic care - the big deal with chronic care for Samaritan - and we're working on a plan design that's gonna hopefully address this - is people with chronic issues that require most of their maintenance is through medication - so, I have chronic asthma, I use a prescription inhaler called {}cort, it runs, without our discount plan, it runs about $300 a month. Lately, I've been getting it for $25, {?} CVS is giving random discounts, and I when they tell you 25 instead of 300 you don't complain - and so I've appreciated that. But, so we do encourage people to have savings for healthcare. But, $300 is manageable. I mean, even at the $300 price. I mean it's something you can set aside, and decide you're gonna eat out less, you tighten down your budget, if it's $3000 that's a whole nother matter. So we know that there's a hole that works along with that, we've been dealing with the hole by making specific exceptions up to this point, so for example, someone had a liver transplant about 3 years ago, and we made the decision that even though it was a prescription, that the anti-rejection medications that the person was gonna have to take, we were gonna share those. Because it's silly to spend $300,000 on a liver transplant and then to not let them have the anti-rejection medication that makes the liver transplant continue to work. So, a few other things that we've made some specific requirements around that, are some of the new cancer drugs, that are replacing chemotherapy - we're sharing those. Like we would if they were a treatment. And so we're working on something that's more of a comprehensive solution. In our design around our plan currently we have a 120 day limit on prescriptions, which if you're taking $4 generics is a non-issue, compared - especially when you're comparing our monthly cost to the monthly cost of what an insurance policy would be - but we know that there are some holes in that, but we're dealing with them temporarily on an exception basis, and we're looking for a redesign on our overall plan to be able to address that.

But as far as the acute care, things like the ICU, things like that, our members are getting those needs met. We're meeting over $25m a month in medical bills among our 70,000 families. You know, I personally had {} where my youngest son was born, and he was born without a heartbeat, his APGAR was zero, for you OBs, he was revived. He spent eleven days in the NICU. He currently is causing lots of trouble for his older sisters in ways 4 year-olds do, but it was $200,000. For the OB, for the emergency section, for the anesthesiologist, for the 11 days in the NICU - we paid our bills. We paid cash. There's no judgment sitting out there - now, I got a discount, cuz I'm not stupid, I know that list price is not what you want to pay for healthcare, but you know, I still paid more than Blue Cross Shield would pay for that. But every single dollar got paid. You know I got notes and cards from 41 different states. I've got a stack in my office this tall of cards from people that I will never meet {}. And they're praying for us, they're encouraging us, and over 400 different families shared in that need. And yes, there's a little bit of beaurocratic nightmare that goes with that, where I'm taking those checks and stamping them and depositing them, but there's also those individual cards - we sat at the dinner table to open up and read, and so, while we're still figuring out how our life works with a newborn baby, people are praying for us, they're encouraging us, they're writing notes - personalized notes - they've never met us, and yet, that's a part of what we do - we connect people to one another in a real way, and the same way that you do with your patients. If you see them face to face. And we do that for people with one another {???}.

*** [25:58] Q1

I have a question. So, if you pay out $50,000 for a surgery, - get these checks from various people throughout the country, do you have to report it as income, then?

*** [26:11] James Lansbury

No. And so, occasionally, we have had members who have gotten audited. And usually what triggers an audit is when you have someone who makes $60,000 who turns in a Schedule A - is there an accountant in the room? We'll call it a Schedule A if it's not - turns in a Schedule A - and deducts the $75,000 surgery. And so, the IRS tends to think that maybe you didn't pay $75,000 for a surgery, and make $60,000, and maybe there's some source of income that you {}. And they've gotten audited. Usually we'd compromise around that. If they have to, they just adjust their Schedule A for the deductions. We tell our members that we don't advise them to deduct those things on their taxes for that reason. We've never had a member get audited otherwise. So we look at this as - they're gifts from one person to another. You are allowed to receive a gift of any amount, from anyone, without paying tax on it. The GIVER is taxed on that if the gift exceeds - I think this year it's $18,000 dollars... it's a large number. It's more than I'm gonna give. So, - but we don't have any members that their monthly share gets up that high, so that's not a big deal for us. But we - other than those big checks - and that's what we tax to the giver, not to the receiver. And so at this point, if a member did get audited, we would defend them, if it got beyond the administrative level, because we think that's important that the members not be taxed on this.

*** [27:38] Q2

Do you think {} it be 51 votes in the Senate for your small building - changes - makes it tax-deductible to pay health savings is and

*** [27:52] James Lansbury

So right now, I am 51% sure that you can't get 51 votes on the Senate on pretty much anything. But, beyond that - what we've actually done is, we've gotta build a {} Congress right now that would allow the use of healthcare sharing ministries with all savings account. instead {} Now we would personally I as a free market person and a little libertarian, I prefer that you didn't have to have anything associated with your health savings account, - insurance of any kind - and forget healthcare sharing ministries in the bill, why carve us out, just carve out the taxpayer and say, hey, do you want a health savings account? Have a health savings account. But, government, they like to tax you. So you don't get that. So, we actually have - we continue to lobby on tax reform bills. I think it's possible that it could happen - we get deductability - but here's the deal - is that our entire lobbying budget as an industry is in the neighborhood of $400,000. Blue Cross Blue Shield spent more than that last... week on lobbyists. And that was probably just at the federal level. If we forget about all they're doing at the state level. And insurance companies, now that we are on the radar screen - which we weren't, for a long time, which is part of the reason the miracle of having this exemption in the Affordable Care Act so that our members are not penalized for not having insurance - now that the insurance companies are aware of us, they're not interested in us being unregulated, and getting any of the benefits that they get. And so tax scheduling of shares is a nice thing, and it's on our list and we've got a few congressmen who are in favor of it, for us {...} congressmen, secretary Price when he was a congressman had some language sitting on that - but we don't think it's likely to move unless it gets lumped into something else, and probably only if the {} lobbyist is sleeping that day. So... I like the idea, though. And if you have 51 senetors that you can get for it, then, we'll talk later.

*** [30:09] Dr. Donna Harrison

So, as Ryan Nash said at the last meeting, Man, you know, we can sit here and talk, but unless we get an action plan from this, Donna, you didn't do anything. So, we need to come to an action plan, and what we're gonna do from here. So, we won't, you know, develop an action plan probably in this group right this minute, but I think some of the talks have brought out ideas for everybody about what needs to happen as next steps - I think we should keep in email communication about those next steps, and maybe, if we'd like to just sort of put general topics, each of the people that moderated, if you wanna, you know, make suggestions to the group as to what you think are the next steps for the section that you moderated, or beyond, then, please do that, if you share it with me I'll put it out on the email group, or, you know, if you want copies, I would, you know, the people that are in this group, we can do it either way, but, I'm happy to act as a mail-delivery system if that works for you guys more conveniently, if you'd like to do that. Do you wanna - yeah, go ahead?

*** [31:30] Dr. Michelle Cretella

During the break, we were discussing that perhaps the best next step is taking lead from Les I think during his presentation he said, get the leaders of each group present - in here - but roughly twelve of us - so we have CMA represented, AAPLOG, ACPedes, CMDA, and we sit down with our representatives from Samaritan Ministries and Thomas More, and actually hash out not necessarily a separate organization with additional funding and ... things we can't.... we already are stretched thin on workers and time. But what do each of our organizations have that could contribute toward this goal? So, it would be the job of our two attorney members to sort of give us some options. So a next action step would be to bring leaders together at the next meeting. Be more concrete.

And what we could do with that is just say, what can be - I'm gonna come to that saying, what can AAPLOG contribute, and what does AAPLOG need to see in terms of structure. You know? So, it's more like, it's more of an exploratory, how can we actually work together once ... format... anybody else have any other actions?

*** [33:03] comment

Yeah, but I think the way it needs to work is you need to make a list of the things that you need which I think were summarized in a lot of presentations today. Put that list together. And then when you get together with a group, you say, who has this? I can offer that. Boom, check. Who has this? Oh, I have something like that, it's not quite exactly the same thing, but I can help you get that. Check. So, if you don't have that list, and you just walk into that room - oh, we'd like to do this, and we'd like to do that... well, how do you ... you're just not gonna get anywhere. My wife goes shopping without a list. But I have the list in my pocket.

*** [33:48] Dr. Donna Harrison

Oh, that reminds me. I want to ask the modarators if they're willing to share their PowerPoint presentations, please send them to me, and I will send them out to several people that've asked if the PowerPoint presentations are available. Specifically. Any other...

*** [34:11] comment 2

This isn't an action plan, but if any of you have not read Clara Grave's book, "The Battle for America's Soul", I highly recommend it, and I would propose that the title of the Hippocratic society is exactly right, based on his book, and he takese through, in a very simplistic way, I could understand it, the history of Hippocratic medicine versus Platonic medicine, which was really good in the state, not pretty good... individual. And he contrasts that throughout the last 2000 years. Anyways. Simplistically done, the title doesn't reflect what it is about, but it's called The Battle for America's Soul, by Dr. {}.

*** [35:01] comment 3

Some of us were talking, too, and it seems that there are, we've got two issues... one was {?} very separate from what.. separate from Hippocratic medicine. Although there's a relationship. We talked, as the Board of {?} Pediatricians, this morning, about maybe trying to work some with the NVPS PAS. I think that's not an unreasonable thing for us to, as, both group, to consider. But then, the bigger issue is practising Hippocratic medicine. And do we set up a brand new organization, or do we find some partnership with which can work? CMDA has this, or David Stevens has his other group, this Medical Ethics Organization... could it serve as an umbrella organization for groups like the American College of Pediatricians, AAPLOG, and kind of like what we were describing, the American Board of ABMS, being the umbrellla organization for these 24 other boards.

*** [36:48] Dr. Donna Harrison

Maybe. Now I{'ll} have to say, part of what Thomas More society can help us to think through is, what does this look like? This great Lutheran question. What does this mean? Okay, because there are currently CMDA - there are medical specialty - AAFP - is under CMDA's board. So, to be under them, would be under CMDA's board, and it's structurally - we'd have to think that could actually work.

*** [37:27] comment 3?

They could spin it off, though.

*** [37:30] Dr. Donna Harrison

So, if they spin it off, if they spun it off, I think it would be a problem, but I think as it currently stands, it would be a problem. So part of what Thomas More society has volunteered to do is to help us look at what are different corporate structures - what's possible - there may be six different corporate structures that we could entertain that would have pros and cons - and so I don't think we can answer the question right now of what structure should we have, I think we have to answer the question of what structure is possible. And which provides which benefits, and what does it mean tax wise, and what does it mean in terms of fiduciary responsibility, you know, cause each of us, different boards have different fiduciary responsibility to our memberships, and, you know, so we, so for example, for us to be a religious organization, which may solve some problems, would actually create some problems for AAPLOG, cuz then we would lose our ability to stand in court next to ACOG and say "we too are a professional ethics society without a religious affiliation." You know, so we have to like work through what the structures look like, and I think at the next meeting we need to come back with, these are possible structures, these are pros and cons. And then we could go on to say, well what should we do. Because I don't think we're at what should we do yet. I think we're still at the information gathering stage in terms of what this looks like. That's my....

Alright, I'm gonna wrap up here, this is not the end of the conversation, we should try again next Spring. The goal would be that we would have another meeting, probably here just because the venue is very inexpensive, and Trinity has been incredibly hospitable to us, and incredibly supportive of what we're trying to do. So we had talked about maybe having a meeting here in six months or so - Farr brought up in his book - so if this works, just kind of think about - and I'll put out dates - of another possible meeting where we can answer those questions, and hopefully we'll meet with Thomas More society before that, and see what the possible corporate structures are, and bring that back here, and just kind of hash out the leadership.

*** [39:38] comment 4

I have a quick {?} for both boards to be present

*** [39:44] Dr. Donna Harrison

If - I mean I was thinking sort of this whole group could be present - or representatives.

*** [39:51] comment 4

Yeah, or representatives. It might be difficult - I'm just thinking it might be difficult for all board members

*** [39:58] Dr. Donna Harrison

    Okay. And representatives from the boards - we have all the board members here right now, which is really beautiful, because we wanted our boards to understand what we're trying to get involved in. But yeah, maybe just representative - smaller group here, in the springtime.

Although we will be talking about a Hippocratic medical society, our vision is, more broadly, fighting for our right to exist, our right to practise with Judeo-Christian ethics. On December 3, we presented the Chicago Declaration on Rights of Conscience and Healthcare, almost as a charter, outlining what we would protect within our medical system. It was drafted for us by {Christopher Ferrara}, who is an attorney. He's the founder and president of the American Catholic Lawyers Association. And it was presented at the December third meeting - which I believe many of you also attended - and after some input, this is the final draft.

"We are an alliance of physicians, nurses, other health professionals, directors of healthcare systems, and and attorneys, numbering several thousand members. We stand together in support of conscience rights for all medical professionals. In particular, we are united in our conscientious commitment to the life-affirming principle of the traditional Oath of Hippocrates, which states, 'I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asks for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art.' 

"We are also committed to ensuring informed consent and self-determination for all patients. No patient should be pressured to accept procedures or outcomes dictated by political and ideological pressures. We are firmly opposed to the harmful effect that political correctness and the dictatorship of relativism have had on the medical profession, whose permanent and universally valid ethical principles must be above all such improper influences. Accordingly, we declare that

"First: Human life is inviolate and must be respected and protected, from fertilization until natural death.

"Second: All human beings, no matter how ill, disabled, or dependent, possess intrinsic dignity and inherent moral status, and are therefore entitled to equal protection under the law, and to universal human recognition and respect as persons.

"Third: No physician or other healthcare professional should be compelled to participate under threat of professional discipline, adverse employment consequences, or othwewise, in 'abortions, embryo-detructive research, assisted suicide and euthenasia,'" and this is key, "'or any other act requiring the disrespect or destruction of a human life.'

"Fourth: Physicians and other healthcare providers have the right in general not to participate - or not to be compelled to participate, under threat of professional discipline or adverse employment consequences, in any procedure that violates their conscience."

The intent there was to cover the LGBT mandates that we can face.

"Fifth: Medical decision-making should be based on the good of the patient and the individual patient-physician relationship, not on the good of the third-party payer or any other social collective.

"Sixth: Medical treatment must be based on the physician's evaluation of the truth about a patient's condition and biological nature; not on appeals to emotion, the demands of political and ideological movements, or the dictates of standard-setting organizations.

"Seventh: Physicians have the right and the duty to present to their patients honestly and compassionately the facts that - according to the physicians' ability and judgment - are necessary for informed consent treatments or procedures, or the withholding of the same.

"Eighth: The practise of medicine is both an art and a science, which recognizes human individuality and the importance of emotional, mental, and spiritual, as well as physical, health.

"Ninth: We deplore and reject all attempts to censer, alter, suppress, or punish the publication of medical evidence that contradicts prevailing beliefs and practises.

"Tenth: Physicians have the right, duty, and responsibility to speak out and act according to their conscience, moral convictions, and scientific understanding, and such principled speech and action is not a rightful basis for professional or other discipline.

"We declare these principles of conscience in the sight of the god who made us all and endowed us with the inalienable right to life and who, as our nation's founding fathers declared, is 'the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions'.

What should be obvious is that while we are adhering to Judeo-Christian ethic for natural law principles, as our founding fathers espoused in the Declaration, we would certainly not exclude non-Christian health professionals, physicians, from participating in any system we set up.

The purpose of this meeting today is a follow-up from the December 3 meeting that we had last year. Looking at: What are the issues involved with Hippocratic medicine, and the continuation of Hippocratic medicine in this country - actually, around the world?. Also, this meeting is a little different in that we really want actionable outcomes. Many of the speakers have prepared short talks, but we need feedback, we need your information. This is more of a discussion than [a] presentation. So, please pester the speakers with questions, and let's have a real discussion on this.

With that, I'd like to introduce <Speaker 3>, who has done extensive work on thinking through the whole process of a Hippocratic medical society.

*** [1-07:56] Speaker 3

I just have some introductary comments, and then, certainly, [I] welcome your thoughts, feedback, questions, and suggestions.

The first comment begins with [this]: what is it that a proposed Hippocratic medical society would be for? I just want to comment on the way that institutions matter for overcoming helplessness. {Charles Taylor}, some of you know, a philosopher - most of his focus has been on the characteristics of modernity, and what it's like to live in a modern world - said that what's a constituent feature of modern life is a sense of "learned helplessness", and that the systems that govern our lives - having become so beaurocratically complex, so multi-layered - seem to us like things that we can't change. One of the things that institutions do, what they're necessary for, is giving people a way of organizing their actions and behavoirs together, cooperations, so they can see a way of being, or doing things differently than the conventional way, than the way that they seem to be invited to by the way things are, the dominant structures.

I think about something as straightforward as ACP or AAPLOG or my own limited experience at <university> in our theology, medicine, and culture initiative - conference on medicine and religion. These kinds of institutions - although tiny drops in the bucket, really, in terms of the size and relative influence for those who are part of them - give an image, a picture in imagination, for the way they can enact their work in healthcare - engage their work in healthcare - differently than they have before; in a way that more aligns with what they believe to be true about themselves, about their patients, [and] about our world. Having an institution like this, I think that the primary purpose of it is a way of responding to what we trust is a latent longing in many physicians and other healthcare practitioners to do their work in a way differently than it's currently being structured; and to do it not just because they can make more money, or have more ease, but because they think it will more align with the truth of who they are and what the practise of medicine is for.

That's the first comment. The second is that I want to raise as a concern and as a point of conversation [is], the extent to which this is construed as a safe haven, versus a form of public organized action by a community of people to contend for something good. Now, any institution like this is of course going to fulfull to some extent both of those roles. But my caution about the language of "safe haven", and, frankly, the language of "rights", is that those languages, in the very meaning of the words, kind of leave undisturbed the way things are. They suggest that we have some personal rights that need to be protected, and that we want the space to be ourselves; and that allows the person hearing us, who's not one of us, who's not thinking with us, to say, "Okay, so people want to carve out, they want to live in their own eclectic ideosyncratic way, fine." Insofar as this society exists in that way, I think there's some good in that. It's good to protect things that are worth protecting, but what excites me and makes me motivated to work on something like this is the possibility that the society be a public challenge to the way things are; a public claim that good medicine is what is described in the tradition of medicine that dates at least to Hippocrates (frankly, earlier than that; certainly [it's] visible in the Hebrews scriptures), but has been adopted and refined and built upon in the western world for more than two thousand years; a practise of medicine that's oriented to the patient's health, and that therefore has these constituent commitments not to kill the unborn, not to kill anyone else, and, basically, to not act in such a way that undermines or contradicts our commitment to the patient's health.

That's an argument that people can hear. I can tell you from personal experience, speaking at medical schools around the country, [that] people can hear the argument that it contradicts medicine to intentionally damage or destroy your patient's health. [They can] recognize, "Woah, there's weight to that, there's something to that." I think this society, insofar as it's going to realize its potential, should be a society that has that orientation. It's not to protect us, principally - although we certainly need protection for our positive action, and we look to the law insofar as it allows it, constitutional and otherwise, for that protection - but it's to sustain and to engage and to push forward and to continue the good work of medicine to which we're committed and to which we call our colleagues to be committed.

The third comment I have, before I say a couple words about the specific proposal you have in front of you, is that the formation and development of the society's form is a very practical political action. We have to take account of the practical political challenges and possibilities. [Some] of the key questions are, what is the flag to which we can rally? Can we have, in this society, commitments that are sufficiently substantive to hold? [Can we] have real content? [Can we] be reasonably understood as congruent with and protective of and continuing good medicine? We're not going to have, for example, a commitment to being "patient centered", and here I think I'll just give you an example. One of the things that's very striking about the traditional marriage vows in, say, the Roman Catholic rite of marriage, or the Anglican book of common prayers rite of marriage, is you have vows that are substantive. You take this person "to have and to hold, forsaking all others, through sickness and health, richer and poorer, till death do you part." It's a pretty simple, but substantive, commitment. It's not abstract. You don't have any vows that "I will love you with all my heart." "I will not take you for granted." A lot of people have wanted to "improve" on those vows by making them more aspirational, more exciting, more emotionally appealing, and yet that actually undermines the purpose of the vows. So, similarly, in a profession in a society like this, each one of us want[s] to say things against certain people because they're really bothering us; we want to say things... [that] we probably shouldn't say, if this society's going to reach its potential.

So, sufficiently substantive to hold, and sufficiently limited to avoid ideosyncrasies and sectarianism. There's no perfect line here. Hippocrates was not a universal figure. He was one character. We don't even know a whole lot about him specifically. The Hippocratic movement was one movement in ancient Greece that we believe identified some things that are true and can be seen as reasonable by others. Hippocratic tradition had some ideosyncrasies. There's stuff in there about cutting for stone... we have to think, "What were they after, there?", and recontextualize it here. There's prayers to Apollo, and to various other Greek deities, that are ideosyncrasies. Those are reasons why we have to recognize that the Hippocratic Oath is a human document. And yet, what's powerful about the Hippocratic tradition is that it was amenable... particularly as it met Christianity, and the Christian community in the second, third, and fourth centuries found the oath and revised it into the form that's called the "Hippocratic Oath Insofar as a Christian May Swear It." That oath, to the best of our knowledge, is much much much more widely disseminated and influential than the original Hippocratic oath ever was. A practical test for this society, I think, will be how its commitments and its oath are construed. Is it a society to which a person could commit, at least in principle, if they were Jewish? If they're Muslim? Or even secular, insofar as they're concerned about the very demoralization of medicine to which this society responds?

So, those are practical concerns, and I think a worry that anybody should have in creating such a society is that we make things not specific enough, or [that] we make it too detailed and have too many commitments, so that the number of people that can gather around that flag is so limited [that] it doesn't have any political purchase.

The proposal I have before you - I'll just identify what are to me some of its critical ambitions. One is that the society be committed to health as an objective, which is to say a genuine, real good, a real thing. Strangely, perhaps, I've noticed that a lot of people haven't really thought this through. Just the claim that medicine is for health does phenomenally extensive work as a criterion to distinguish what physicians are obligated to do and what they're not obligated to do. If you take up any of the kind of practices that stirred the formation of the ACP and AAPLOG and others, take them one by one, I can show you in each case that although the practice - let's say - of contraception may be by a particular person opposed because it violates magisterial teaching of the Roman Catholic Church of God (unitive/procreative dimensions of sexuality), it also can be shown - I think quite reasonably - to be not clearly required by a commitment to the patient's health. It's not clear that making a young woman sterile is an act congruent with the person's health, since health is expressed in part by capacity to achieve pregnancy as a young person. And obviously with abortion, assisted suicide, gender transition services, it shows how far we've gone culturally to being committed to the body having no meaning whatsoever, so we can just reshape it or renew it. Action appeals to your sense of your own inner expression. But even that can clearly make an argument that to change otherwise healthy secondary sex characteristics is not clearly required by a person's commitment to health, and therefore should be nothing that physicians are obligated to do. And I think in this society we would say physicians should not be involved in it.

The commitment to health is an objective for it. That can be contrasted [with a] framework of [an] ancient tradition of medical ethics as a moral art, oriented to the patient's good. One way which is helpful rhetorically is to contrast a commitment to health [with] the commitment to patient wellbeing, where wellbeing is a subjective concept, and that is the concept that contemporary medicine persues unapolagetically in its language of saying, "Well, for this person, maybe for their health, THIS is important to them." You can define wellbeing so broadly that really the only person who can decide what is for their wellbeing is the person themself. You can't have a professional oriented to that. You can only have providers of healthcare services.

This commitment to health, importantly, doesn't answer every question. It allows for margins. Health is a complicated thing, and how to persue it is complicated. And it allows, within the boundaries of not intentionally damaging or destroying health, for a society to be able to continue to seek to discern whether this practise is really congruent with health, or whether it is not. And we need that kind of discernment because we can't say right now all of the practses that are worthwhile, and all that aren't.

The society will be committed to conscientious practise, which is stated in the declaration of conscience. The key in there, to me, is not a "right of conscience," again. If I hear someone declare to have a "right of conscience", and it involves me, what I hear them saying is, "I'm about me and protecting myself from you." If we're going to be committed to our patient's health, we have an obligation to practise conscientiously. Conscientiously - the etymology of this is that we practise according to our best judgment about what we ought to do. We refuse to do the things we don't think we should do, and we do the things we believe we must do.

That is a retrieval that a lot of physicians want - we long for - insofar as it emphasizes that the positions have to have agency, use judgment, and bear responsibility. And, crucially - this is important - what we're after here, I think, is to change the dynamic. Because the end of medicine is being construed both explicitly and implcitly in contemporary medicine as patient "wellbeing", which is a subjective norm that only the patient can really fill in in a given case. With that as a norm, the default is, you should do anything that's legal, that you can do feasibly, technically, and doesn't have an immediate threat of overt bodily harm; and if you're not going to do it, the onus is on you to say why. Why? What's your reason? How do you justify it? Insofar as we are committed to health, and committed to practising conscientiously, the dynamic flips, and then the question is, why do you think this practise you want me to participate in is so clearly required by my commitment to the patient's health? So the onus is on others to demonstrate that a particular practise is required by us, because we profess to seek our patient's health. Clearly, sometimes that can be met.

Just a little quibble with the declaration of conscience... it says somewhere that "physicians ... can never be compelled to do anything they don't think they should do ... any procedure that violates their conscience." Well, yes and no. You can't have a profession if you don't live up to your profession. And insofar as your profession requires certain actions - let's say a woman or a man right here is having a heart attack, and I know how to do CPR, and I just stand by and don't do it because I'm tired - had a long day - then I think you could say that [I]'ve basically failed to fulfill [my] vocation. Much worse if you're in an ER and they show up in your ER and you don't do that. So, there are clearly some things that we are required to do. But the onus is on people. When we give a conscientious claim that a particular practise is not consistent with our profession, the onus is on others to show why it must be. When you pull up these practises that are controversial today, I think you're going to have a really hard time making that argument. That's been my experience in debating about these things at various universities the last ten years.

We respect not so much - my language - patients' "self-determination" [as their] "authority." We do not have authority over everyone. We do have authority, we believe, over our own actions, and particularly, as physicians making a profession, we have authority to make judments about what our profession requires. We have to be accountable to one another, but that is our authority. We respect patients' authority, we respect its limits. I think that the oath has to have the traditional affirmations and prohibitions: against deadly remedies, against abortion, against sex with your patients, against violating confidentiality. Those have to be contextualized with today's language. We've taken a stab [at it] in the oath that you have in front of you. In my judgment, we need to not have more.

Again, this goes back to [being] substantive, but not [having] so much detail that you become very ideosyncratic. I don't think this kind of society should have dogmatic statments about healthcare financing. You can see the language I've put in there. It seems to me that physicians of principle, in their orientation to health, are open to any kind of organization of financing in healthcare, insofar as that organization facilitates, is conducive to, doesn't pose obstacles to or contradict, their professional commitments to their patients' health. There are reasons to oppose certain healthcare financing BECAUSE of the way that they interfere... but this shouldn't be about healthcare financing, or other pet issues.

I'll stop there. Those are my initial thoughts.

*** [1-29:32] Comment 3.1

Having struggled as an OB/GYN, and trying to articulate why we don't kill our second patient in the womb, this whole issue of "health" is a real problem, because how you define "health" really is the whole core of it. We have to define it, because what we're committed to as private physicians is the health of our patient. I don't think you're going to be able to avoid defining that. Right now, legally, as of Doe v. Bolton, "health" is defined as "any physical, psychological, social, familial, or any other reason which affects a woman's decisions." It's enshrined in Doe v. Bolton - the legal definition of "health" - so that's what we're going to have to come up against. Part of what we've wrestled with is, is there another word, like "health," which equals "wellbeing," so I would just ask you...

*** [1-30:30] Speaker 3

We will have to say, "When we say 'health,' we mean the following..." There's been some tremendous work in that respect. Frankly, I think the best work done in the last 50 years is by {Leon Kass}. We have to make the point that health is not construed in the World Health Organization form of the "complete state of psychological, social, physical, spiritual wellbeing", but that it's a bodily good; {Kass} calls it "the well working of the organism as a whole", or "an activity of the body in accordance with its specific excellences" - which are you know, kind of clunky, in a way - but the point is, you can't make sense of the Hippocratic affirmations and prohibitions, apart from in death {00:31:26 ?}, if you define health as broadly as it's been defined. We would have to clarify that.

*** [1-31:34] Comment 3.2

To what you opened with, you're right: This is not just the process of contending, "Oh, let us be, let us practise the way we want". We're contending - we're putting an argument out there - [that] this is what real medicine is. This is how you bring about human lordship. It comes back to combining what we know about good medicine and science with an actual law. We can't escape that this is a philosophical... We got here because of the Enlightenment kicking God out of science. We definitely need to bridge that gap. So, definitions... the language matters.

*** [1-32:22] Speaker 3

The language matters.

*** [1-32:24] Comment 3.3

I have a couple questions about consent and confidentiality.

As a pediatrician, I give an awful lot of shots to kids that don't consent to it. Until a child reaches a certain age, the parents consent for the child. But that's not in the way that this is worded.

On confidentiality: Parents need to know if their kids are experimenting with drugs [or] if their kids are having sex. Even if the children are not in imminent serious harm, they're still putting themselves at harm. I think a little tweaking of the language there would be helpful. The last point: "never divulge confidential information about a patient".

*** [1-33:35] Speaker 3

That's a very important thing. I think that's an important footnote, probably, that has been regarded as such for centuries,  and that's where I think the language of authority is important. Kids don't have authority to make their own choices - at least, not all their own choices, not all their healthcare choices - so we respect the authority of those who have that authority. Their parents, in this case. By "authority" here I don't just mean legal authority, I mean reasonable moral authority to make these choices.

*** [1-34:16] Comment 3.4

I think one of the things that people <indistinct> wrong is, if confronted with the reason why we wouldn't do a particular treatment or a particular surgery or a particular action based on conscience, that it would be incumbent upon us to provide that explanation. The difficulty is that we're all encumbered, now, under this mantra of evidence-based medicine, and whose evidence, and what gets published, and where it gets published, and what is more generally accepted. There are things that go into the formation of conscience, in my view, that are beyond scientific evidence. There is an intuitive moral and spiritual element that whispers to us, if you will, in knowing the difference [between] what's right and what's wrong. Although we may not have overwhelming evidence to say otherwise, I don't see how that would compromise our justification of making that decision. Because if we're debating this with someone else on the other side, "Why don't you do gender reassignment surgery as an OB/GYN?" and I explain it to them, "Well, that's not what the literature says, that's not what's in the ACOG journals", or this and that and the other one, and they would be right from the preponderance of what is published. But just because it's published in a journal in the United States doesn't mean that that is the end all and be all evidence of what is the right thing.

*** [1-36:07] Speaker 3

This is an example of the kind of thing that, as I imagine, a society of Hippocratic medicine (or however the title is put)... Societies have to get formed around some core commitments, and then within that community, you're going to need dialogue and literature and articles and training that help people understand, for example, how we make sense of evidence-based medicine; what are the limits of evidence; in our making clinical decisions, what part does scientific evidence play, and what are the limits of the part that it plays. We'd have, I imagine, these well-written, cogent articles about this, that people [would] have access to; materials that physicians could share with their patients and share with their colleagues; and position statements, even. But we wouldn't have a dogmatic claim, it seems to me, about how people have to think about evidence-based medicine, so much as we want to point out the way that these commitments - commitment to health, commitment to sustain medicine as it's been traditionally practised - as implications for how we think of evidence-based medicine.

*** [1-37:37] Comment 3.5

I'm new to this organization, and new to this newest organization you're trying to launch. As for my cultural, psychological, spiritual perspective, I consider myself and others as "healthcare providers". Sometimes it would be safer not to use the term "physician", but "healthcare providers", and a few <indistinct> can say "physician", "nurse", "clinicians", "practitioners".

*** [1-38:10] Comment 3.6

I disagree. The "provider" language was introduced by HMOs in the 90s. It was fought against by physician organizations as a de-professionalization term to try to marginalize anyone to a technocratic field; that if you just had a couple of pet procedures... it's a replaceable part in a machine. I fight against the use of the word "provider" in even my secular health system language, because I think it diminishes and marginalizes the profession as a profession. Instead of interchangeable parts... I think Farr in his language does extend an opportunity for non-physicians to be part of the movement, but... if physicians don't lead, physicians will not have healthcare. Physicians in other countries have been taken out of the whole conversation.

*** [1-39:11] Speaker 3

If I could, I want to appreciate something you're saying. I think you're alluding to the fact that medicine - at least in my understanding - is not just practised by physicians. Medicine is that domain of human activity oriented to preserving and restoring patients' health and those whose health is threatened or diminished. When a nurse practitioner takes care of someone who's sick, he or she is practising medicine.

*** [1-39:37] Comment 3.5

My point is to open this up, hopefully, for future healthcare practitioners, or...

*** [1-39:45] various

Clinicians.

Professionals.

But not "providers."

*** [1-39:52] Comment 3.5

<indistinct> one point. The other is what <Speaker 1> was trying to say - seems like you're starting a new organization - separating ourselves from some mainstream, creating something - at the same time, challenging the mainstream, modern belief system, ideology, technology, and so forth. So maybe that's a dual vision and mission we can do, because sometimes separating can be exploration <uncertain>. But we need to stay engaged in American psychological institution. Most of them, they go on, practising, spiritual person... <indistinct> a member of other Christian psychological institution, but also a member of that. So, challenging and retraining <possibly "reframing"> psychology and medicine in its original form - and of course there will be some battle along the way - also we can start another one and then can open with <indistinct>. Other point about... number eight...

*** [1-41:07] Speaker 3

You're looking at the declaration.

*** [1-41:09] Comment 3.5

...which recognizes human individuality and the importance of emotional, mental, and spiritual, as well as physical, health <uncertain>. Perhaps it would be good to not emphasize only on the individualism, but include collectivism as well. Cause we are social and cultural beings as well. We cannot exist without - so individualism and collectivism would be recognized. And include the term "social" or "cultural" <uncertain>, as well. <indistinct> Every profession has a common code of ethics and legal procedures, so we are obliged to stay with that, but yet now we cannot say, "No, [what] our conscience tell[s] us [is a] little different than the code of ethics." That becomes a symmetric discussion, as well. Where are we in common with that code of ethics, and where do we break and say, "No, our ethics is higher or different..." <indistinct>

*** [1-42:22] Speaker 3

In terms of my speaking about the document, we have a society of Hippocratic medicine... [I'm reminded] me of something that's in my mind a lot - may not be in all of yours - but I want to put it on the table. This goes back again to "substantive, but not too ideosyncratic". Roman Catholics have a long tradition of affirming natural law, and move pretty fluidly with the idea that reason can see clearly what medicine is for, and so on. For the most part, Protestants have adopted a lot of that reasoning - if they're what I'll call "conservative Protestants". Liberal Protestantism has gone pretty fully into the idea that wellbeing is something that each person has to discern on their own. But there are Jewish, Muslims, Orthodox Christians, and others, [who] have challenged whether there is any such things as a rational knowledge of what health is that we have access to outside of the community of church and sacraments and tradition over receiving, and so would say [that] you really need to be practising medicine as the church teaches you, not according to a timeless form that Hippocrates discerned. Certainly my Jewish colleagues who are orthodox say, "You know, look, the key for us to practise medicine is [that] the commitment to the patient's health is very much a part of our tradition. When you get to the details, it's what the Halakha - the law - requires. We wouldn't expect anybody to follow that. That is a Jewish thing."

I would be supportive of this socienty not making claims about... It's one thing to commit to things like "We're not going to practise abortion", "We're not going to give our patients deadly remedies", "We're going to persue the patient's health" - those are things that are intelligible to everybody - and we can recognize people are going to argue on the margins about what health requires. It's another thing to sort of say, "The natural law holds the following...", or that we have a particular construal that anybody who's reasonable would see. I think, insofar as we slide toward that, we're going to find that we get narrower and narrower - even of those who consider themselves Christians - who can be onboard. This is a practical political challenge. It's like <indistinct> Abraham Lincoln (who I've become rather infatuated with, over the last ten years, reading biographies of his), and how he had to find ways of pulling together those who could be pulled together to enact legislation and take steps politically that he thought were the best, and it was hard to do. Insofar as you want to get everything into a piece of legislation, or form a society, you'll find that you kind of break down <indistinct> actually getting a political movement going.

*** [2-00:01] Speaker 2

Thank you very much for setting a practical stage for this.

I want to take a minute and recognize some of the different groups that are here, because I realize a lot of you may not know each other. We have the board of the American Associaton of Pro-Life OB/GYNs, members of the American Association of Pro-Life OB/GYNs, the board of the American College of Pediatricians, representatives from Franciscan Alliance (they're a large health organization), legal representatives from Thomas More Society (who [have] graciously volunteered to help us with the legalities of this), representatives from Samaritan Ministries (very important - one of those grandfathered organizations that was exempt from the Affordable Care Act, and supports rights of conscience for physicians), and other organizations.

One important thing. <Speaker 3> has given a proposal for a separate 501(c)(3), and we haven't, as boards, or as a society here, clarified whether we want this thing that we're doing to look like a coalition of different organizations, or a separate organization. That will be one of the things that we'll have to discuss and sort of hash out. But it isn't a <indistinct>.  We're in the process of thinking about, "What should this look like, what does this mean?" Thank you.

*** [2-02:44] Speaker 4

<Speaker 2> asked me to make some comments, and I'm going to be very candid.

I am for this movement, and I want it to be a positive movement. It's funny to me that there are other things going on in the culture that are doing similar things. How much should we be trying to change the culture and claim the Christian heritage of the United States, or how much should we try to wall off and protect our culture, when we're under an onslaught? I think that this is a larger societal question. Medicine is a very important microcosm of that larger debate. I'm a both-and kind of guy. I think we have to prepare. I'll get to the language use later. Everyone's going to see right through it. It's going to be attacked, it's going to be attacked hard, it's going to be marginalized, and it's going to be marginalized in a way - especially if it tries to use secular language - that is going to be very powerful, and may even marginalize many of the people that are preactising. It's a dangerous thing. I think we cannot overstate the kind of tumultuous times we're in.

The recent election - and President Trump, whether you're a fan of his or not - has uncovered a societal rage that I think gives us all pause. I'm a rabid anti-communist. I'm an anti-Marxist. And I see a MASSIVE leftward push created by the chaos around the opportunity to conflate anyone who is a peace-loving Christian with a Neo-Nazi, a Confederate, a neo-whatever; to try to make anyone who's Conservative right up there with the greatest evil scourge of Satan himself. And I'm afraid this looks like it's going to be remarkably successful. Remarkably successful. 

So, I agree with the urgency. I mean, we're about twenty years behind. It's a shame that when we had someone like {06:03 name?}, we didn't make more progress. Would [that] we had someone like that now (even though I don't agree with ALL his of his positions). I think we're in dangerous times, and I don't think it could be overstated. At a major secular university, I am attacked from faculty for being Christian. Not even over specific positions; not even over specific claims, or policies, or practises, or speeches, or papers; just the thought of someone who is Christian, and may actually have hired <gasp> another Christian to work for me, is scandalous. The president of our university will offer all kinds of condolences [and] offers of solidarity with anyone who feels marginalized on the Left, but - and I pointed out to him - he nver makes such gestures to those that maybe are on the Right, or people of faith; the physicians that are in and out of my office, saying, "I don't know if I can do this. I don't know if I can do this practise any more. What are they going to have me do next?"

We are at the death-throes of European Western Christendom. If there is going to be a movement, I think it needs to be not an academic movement merely, yet it needs to be an academic movement. It need not be just a professional safe haven movement, but it needs to be that. It needs to be a bold movement that proclaims a correction of history - though I would avoid certain parts of history. I would avoid Nazi Germany. I would just avoid it. It's not an historical study that we need to be in. I view that the Stalinists were one of the greatest scourges to ever hit the face of the earth. I think Hiroshima and Nagasaki were horrible crimes against mankind. We could make all kinds of comments on the outpouring of violence around World Wars. But I would not form a society based on that. I wouldn't want any language... I'm going far afield...

We have a critical time to try to reclaim something that is kind of a Western Christian medicine. And we'll likely do this, but for many of us, what we'll have to say [is], "Is it worth fighting for? Is it worth losing my physician for? Is it worth being the target [of] a very active resistance?" If we ARE going to do this, we should actually learn from the resistance - the people that resist us. The progressives that have run some of the most amazingly successful grassroots campaigns over the last thirty years. If you look at the LGBTQ+ movement, it is remarkably successful. I think we can actually look to our opposition, those who oppose us, for some tips on how to do it successfully. But I think it must be bold.

The need, I think, has been articulated. It often is thought about as around abortion, and contraception and reproductive technologies - although some Protestant groups will accept contraceptive technologies, and some other groups... of course, we know that Roman Catholics, as a people, accept them quite well, even though the traditional church doctrine says otherwise. Similarly, Orthodox. We have a bigger problem: we don't reproduce. We have a major reproduction issue. The American Christians, and European Christians, just don't reproduce. And so, in a few generations, we'll be less relevant, unless the Gospel proceeds without us.

So, contraception [and] reproductive technologies are issues within medicine. Assisted suicide and voluntary active euthenasia, now cleverly rebranded as "physician-aided dying", is now legalized in Canada and will be legal in every state in the United States in the short term, I do believe. Along with it, voluntary active euthenasia. I hope I'm... but I think it will be coming to a neighborhood near you.

"Gender reassignment", reproductive technologies, and abortion [are] going to be where the health language fails. I mean, it's success, but it's already failed, because "women's health" won the day by redefining "women's health", following all kinds of debauchery being what we call "health". The reframing of "health", now that gender dysphoria is a disorder, and it needs a specific, efficient treatment... That is not proven, of course, but we need a study, actually, to prove it may be eventually harmful. That is gender reassignment. Those studies are underway. All you have to do is change the endpoint. If you can make the endpoint, "I am self-satisfied with my new status", then all of the sudden you have "empirical" data showing that something does improve health and meets the new standard of care. I think the "health" language games is up, unless you define it specifically. At Ohio State University, the official furthering of Buddhism and mindfulness and yoga for health and wellness is officially endorsed, while no Christian practises are furthered. Anti-Christian and non-Christian definitions of "health" are furthered, while the Christian one is silent.

I think there's a need, in defining "health", that we take trascendent. Tim Quill, when he was saying why assisted suicide was so good, used this image of someone going off into the sunset. Prove that one! Maybe they're going somewhere else. Maybe really hot. May not a sunset. If you're going to take the eternal eschatological consequences seriously - transcendent arguments - we must insist that a definition of "health" is not just imminence and efficiency, but is also about trascendent eschatological health. I mean, look, the soul doesn't die. Eternity's a whole lot longer than our usual lifespan. Whether we're healthy in soul, whether we have <indistinct>, whether we have spiritual life, that should be - and was - the main care of the Christian Hippocratic Movement. It was not the main care of other Hippocratic movements.

And, of course, we have an attack on conscientious practise. I like "conscientious practise" over "conscientious refusal" or "objection", because we're practising conscientiously. I don't like "rights" language. There's the French human rights tradition, the <indistinct> rights langauge, and they're very different "rights" language[s]. Then there's the American "come all" tradition of rights. They're just different. So, I prefer "conscientious practise".

The main people that I know that have a problem with all these issues... I mean, I can find some Orthodox Jews that are concerned, but they're pretty well walled off. They have their community and they can nullify, de facto, because they have a normal <indistinct> option - already happening. The same is happening with conservative Muslims. They have the ability to practise within their movement, their community, even if there is a de jour requirement for something. They can nullify because they can maintain their practise with like-minded patients and individuals, and the insurance probably would never know. The people that I know that have problems with the issues that we're concerned with are Christian. This is one of the conversations that I often have: how the Christian can ultimately be, if something like this is to move forward. [We] can divide things into several categories. The functionalist [argument] is that we could reduce the society down to certain principles that are agreed upon [by] physicians. The essentialist [argument] (me) is that Christ changes everything. Just... everything. The definition of "health" changes. I further that there is something inherently different about the different Hippocratic traditions - between the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian Hippocratic traditions. Medical history is a shameful mixed bag of practises on all those issues. Calling upon the history of medicine is dangerous. You're going to die by that same sword. Look, euthenasia was practised throughout history, even in Christian, Hippocratic eras. I wouldn't say that it was a good, faithful, Christian practise, of course, but calling upon historical claims is not sufficient.

Christ changes all. If you create an organization that includes non-God-fearing Christians - I'm not talking about theological differences between Reformed Evangelicals and Orthodox and Roman Catholics that are traditionalist - I'm going to lump all those kind of Evangelical Christians and traditional Roman Catholics and traditional Orthodox into one thing and just say that they're God-fearing Christians - if you allow non-God-fearing Christians into your group, you can and you should expect departure, or else you don't pay attention to organizations and history. There is going to be departure. I hold, and I encourage, that the group, however it's formed, have leadership, vision, and control, set by God-fearing physicians that claim Christ as Lord, and that there be a mechanism [by which] that is perpetuated, explicitly. If not, this will be a flash in the pan and it will go away. It will depart. It will go along with the zeitgeist. Because it will be so politically incorrect. Look, you have to be willing to be a martyr in order to withstand this. Be honest. You can't be a politican. Politicians have to go by which way the wind blows. Others may be allowed, so I'm not saying that it must be... I would be for the formation of a Christian Hippocratic society. I think it would be great. I think we have some roots for that in Christian organizations already. I'd be for that, if someone wants to further that. I think in December, most people were not for a Christian Hippocratic society. I would be. But you could make membership broader through a functionalist way. For instance, expanding to non-God-fearing Christians, and expanding to non-physicians. You could do that in a functionalist way, based on certain concepts of health, certain prohibitions and prescriptions. Fewer prescriptions than prohibitions. In December, I questioned, "Why Hippocratic?" I actually kind of like it, now. As I study more of the Christian Hippocratic positions, I like it. I don't like basing ethics in kind of a new Hippocratism, but that's another whole conversation.

Orthodox, traditional Catholics, Protestants... theologically conservative... the essential is fear of God and lordship of Christ. That needs to be [in the] leadership. Division needs to be planted by that, it needs to be perpetuated somehow, or else I don't have any hope for this being true. It may be effective, but it wouldn't be true.

Another one. "Is Christian medicine lost?" is one of the questions. I mean, I think, especially in training... Mmany of you know far more about this because, I think, OB/GYN, and now pediatrics quickly on its tails, are the two specialties that are facing such a great run. If I have a pro-life medical student in my office, and she says, "I want to be an OB/GYN", I say, "Oh, are you sure? You know how hard that's going to be? Do you know how hard it's going to be to find the right training porgram? I mean, just to survive and get a good evaluation on your rotation, if you let them know - I mean, if it's public - and, wow, I mean, you're going to have to really play a game on who you divluge that to, and what you'll participate in, and that's hard." Have you all had that same experience? I mean, I think psychiatry's very difficult. There are a few psychiatrists that respect religious experience, but they're... I know religious people that have been accused of being psychotic when they were doing something completely consistent with their faith. I've known trainees that have been accused of problems because they actually accepted the tenets of their traditional faith. Pediatrics - palliative medicine, I think - is moving quickly to formally endorse assisted dying. I was on [an] ethics committee. [I] tried and failed to change their physician-aided dying statement. It's quickly moving there. <indistinct> medicine is, increasingly, only about a spiritual type of care that's foreign to Christianity, and actually at odds with it. And even, according to church fathers, demonic. At law, we know in Canada that physician-aided dying is now the law of the land and a right for their citizenry, and they had a great debate, and continually [have a] great debate over whether conscientious refusal, or conscientious practise, will be allowed by Canadian physicians. Canadian physicians have essentially been silenced. They have no clout. They have no credibility. They're being regulated without a legitimate voice of authority in this debate, as best I can assess. And the debate is going, predictably, the way of abortion in the United States. This will be a question of conveyance. Whether it's legitimate enough; if you have no physician in a given territory that will provide physician-aided dying, whether it is a reasonable burden for the patient to transfer to another regiion in order to procure that legal medical treatment. And you will likely have kind of a Canadian Planned Parenthood for physician-aided dying coming soon. Or, you can get rid of conscientious practise, which is now just a small regulation - it's not in the statutes, it's just in the regulation. They can change that fairly easily. Oregon - of course, the Death with Dignity Act has one of the strongest conscientious refusal clauses. It's only a couple sentences, but it's fairly easy to remove those over time. And if you don't know, <indistinct> and Zeke Emmanuel - Zeke Emmanuel should be at least a household name - wrote in April in the New Englash Journal of Medicine, calling for all medical societies to ban conscientious practise.

It gets worse.

So, regulations and outcome-based medicine. The outcome-based medicine has the potential of creating a tautology. It's a wonderful political tool for creating a tautology. It's like gender-reassignment; if you create an outcome that has to be self-reported - "I no lonegr feel dysphoric" - then, by circular reasoning, you can create a new definition of "health" that is built upon an epistomology of self-gratification. Outcome-based medicine is actually an enemy to traditional medicine when it is applied in such a way. It can be used as a tool, a political tool, to redefine "health". Redefine "medicine". And then regulations come to enforce these. It's amazing how much things like managed Medicaid [are] demanding consideration of practises, including gender-reassignment. CMS has mandated that insurances that are doing managed Medicaid or Medicare cannot deny gender-reassignment as a policy; they have to take [it] case by case. And, of course, the activist groups are looking for the test case to bring more suits to what could have been a very different supreme court. Who knows, now, what it would do. I don't know. Maybe our legal friend would know better. The regulations of outcome-based medicine are a challenge to traditional Christian medicine. I mean, look, you have a society that doesn't have any appreciation for suffering. I often have said that the French philosopher <indistinct> talks about the shift of a society from the trinity of traditional humanism - liberty, fraternity, equality - which was a product of the Enlightenment - to the new humanism, which is really a hedonism, of health, security, and the persuit of pleasue, with the persuit of pleasure being the chief goal, and with suffering being the greatest enemy. Orthodoxy doesn't share the same kind of redemptive suffering theology as Roman Catholics, but [they] have a clear place of finding God in the midst of suffering - an appreciation of suffering as reality that medicine should not try to totalize <uncertain>. Many Protestants have come to similar conclusions.

I think Christian medicine has been lost. I don't think this task is merely trying to claim something that is; it's trying to recapture what has already been lost.

My specific task is to try to say, "How can we impact students in medical schools?" I think we can use something like the Gold Humanism in Medicine model, that made a big impact in different medical schools, but I don't think that's sufficient. If you have kind of the spokes of your wheel... you can think of how we can impact medical students. Gold Humanism in Medicine - which I actually think will be quite contrary to this movement - I mean, I think it has some leaders [who] would be sympathetic, but I think there are also many [who] would think it was very problematic - they became a student organization, but also they become known for their lapel pins. They became part of the White Coat Ceremony. They became part of a kind of de facto second honor's society, beside Alpha Mega Alpha, for medicine. They gave awards out to students, and they've been incorporated into medical schools across the country in a very effective way. I think they can be a model.

Easy partnerships... CMDA (Christian Medical Dental Association), I think, is one of the main vehicles that should be used, along with Catholic Medical Association. (There is no Orthodox medical association that I know. There's a group that holds a conference, but they're... not the right people. They're just not.) Benjamin Rush Institute [is a] fascinating new institute that has got a lot of energy fairly quickly. These are mainly conservative and libertarian medical students that are focused more about the freedom and the financing in medicine, but I think it's a very important group that can be partnered with. AAPS could be [a] good vehicle for this. I think what the vehicles are doing are trying to find champions. Champions at specific institutions. We need academic credibility. I don't think it needs to be an academic movement MERELY; it needs to be a multifaceted movement. But it needs academic credibility in order for medical schools to embrace it, because there will be opposition.

So, I think the initial targets... I love the idea of an advertising campagin, of saying, "Is your doctor a Hippocratic doctor? Do you know who you're getting your healthcare from? Is your college, your medical school, a Hippocratic medical school?" I think there's still a large enough group of conservative-minded people, God-fearing people, and Christian people, that this could still be effective. I think that, actually, we can take a note from those who are trying to have a massive push Left, and create a counter-movement, to say, "Yes, we are in culture wars; we're coming apart as a nation; and there should be medicine that holds to a tradition that is Christian and Hippocratic in character." Do we need another student group, or coalition of existing student groups? I think both. I think a Hippocratic medical society should have a student group arm, and I would see that student group arm as acting as an opportunity for these various student groups to come together. This already happens; CMDA and CMA often have joint meetings and joint alliances.

Initial targets... I think there's some obvious Christian-in-name medical centers... but I think, strategically, we need a few prominent secular centers right off the bat. It doesn't launch until you have those secure, and you can get those secure pretty quickly. I think we may have some sympathetic deans and university presidents in a couple of different instutitions. I have a couple in mind. I may be wrong, because they may be shackled by their public relations people.

Graduate medical education residency programs are often neglected in any movement that tries to engage medical schools. I think including them from the beginning is necessary. Giving energy to the CMA and the CMDA to try to reach residency programs would be an added benefit. This can be done though various program[s]... prepare them to be Bippocratic physicians when they practise... Preparing graduate medical education between residents and internts - how they can find a practise, how they can find funding mechanisms and hospitals that will allow them to practise medicine in a way that they want - I think, will be [a] unique opportunity for a Hippocratic medical society - to further this kind of education. They need to be involved from the beginning - not once further things are established.

One of the mechanisms that a Hippocratic medical society needs to have, because there's going to be so much blowback, is reporting and assistance offerings. So there needs to be a website, a hotline, a way that students and residents can report problems as they encounter them, and there needs to be on-the-ground faculty champions at different institutions, and national representation, and the potential for legal support, when those things happen. We need support for the anticipated blowback.

I'm going to strongly encourage that a Hippocratic medical society try to branch into bioethics. I see some very concerning trends. I think there is an activist move Left. The Association of Bioethics Program Directors is now offering public position statements that are nothing but anti-Trump political tools. They recently signed on something that was pro-DACA. [This was] pointed that out to them... a speech by Robert Jordan in 1995, and Bill and Hillary Clinton in 2005... [ABPD was] being used as a political tool. But [there were] two votes against, and sixty-seven votes for. Bioethics [is] becoming a political tool to say, "We hate Trump". Within that organization, there's already been a proposal for a position statement against religious freedom. I don't know if you heard that. There's already been a proposal for a position statement in bioethics against religious freedom.

It's worse, because bioethics, like medicine, and like some other specialties - chaplaincy, for instance - is pursuing credentialing standards that I believe are intentionally pushing physicians out of the field. I'd love to talk to lawyers in the room. I think we have to have legal faces in all of this. I think it's time to lawyer up, if we're going to fight back. I really do. This is an anti-trust case. Bedside clinical decision-making, last I checked, was constituent of physicians' practise, and now there's a credentialing body trying to say, "We philosophers and others are going to own the really really hard cases in bioethics." And the credentialing and accreditation process is becoming too onerous for physicians... You're going to have a reality of ethics in medicine being decided outside of medicine. And bioethics programs are largely anti-Christian. I may be stating things with hyperbole, [but] I don't think so. There are a couple of Christian programs, but as a large part, they are not. So, I would say that we need to include bioethics in all we do, including, potentially, forming alternative credentialing accreditation for bioethicists and bioethics programs.

The conscientious objection matter... I don't know enough about it. Someone will have to fill in that gap. I know there's some things happening in Mississippi, but I think that something on the federal level... I don't know enough about it, but I think that the grassroots effort - if there was an effort, I didn't know about it, [which] shows that the grassroots wasn't good enough. The role of a Hippocratic medical society, I think, would be key, and I can see if that's an alignment point that could be one of the things that spreads, launches the Hippocratic medical society, saying, "We're going to get this act passed," and then, as we create relationships and alliances and coalitions, THAT is our first action point, so we don't just say, "Hey, we want you to be a member of this society." We say, "Hey, sign on to this, let's do this together - and while you're at it, join this society," giving them an action point along the way. I think there's [a] definite need from the beginning to have things like white papers and statements that show that there's been a lot of thought that went into this medical society. Having a website - you don't exist unless you have one, apparently, in the modern era - but it does really help, especially for the students and the residents, and for a generation that think through these spiffy websites. I mean, it doesn't have to be a spiffy website, it doesn't have to be complex, but it needs to really clearly educate. I would include rolling out on that website, and the position papers, things like videos that give a correct history of medicine, [and] give a concept of health that is respectful. I think we can even tap into the diversity langauge, saying, "If you're going to accept diversity, accept me." But we know that the diversity language is a game. People don't really have a concern with diversity; they just want to silence voices that they can marginalize as not accepting a person.

There needs to be some sort of public display. Something public. I don't know what. I'm not for demonstrations or open air rallies in the current... I think that would be bad. I don't want masked Antifa coming after me. I do like Poland. How many know what Poland is doing? I just saw a press release, a little news blurb. Of course, it was in Russian... The Poles were calling for, on the anniversery of the Battle of Lepanto... Not enough of you smiled. Because, unfortunately, we've erased history. So, the Battle of Lepanto was the great victory of Christendom over Islam. Read G. K. Chesterton's wonderful poem on the conflict. It's politically incorrect, and banned, probably, in most schools... probably no one cares. But on the anniversery of the Battle of Lepanto, the Poles have been called to go to the border of Poland and pray the Rosary. Because that's what the king did before the Battle of Lepanto. He said, "Pray the most holy Theotokos, the mother of God, that we have victory in battle." And that victory came. So, they go to the border, and pray for hope. That's beautiful! I'd even risk Antifa for that.

So, can we start, and can we agree? I think so. We just have to have someone leading people, like academic people. We have to stop polishing our nuclear arsenal and let them fly. Which is what we do. I mean, we have the best battleships available, and aircraft carriers, and nuclear arsenal, and we Christians and conservative people - probably BECAUSE we're conservative, and we'd rather be at home, or working. Conservative people - like Clint Eastwood said in that bizarre little thing he did with the stool - are conservative. They don't necessarily want to get out there and do things. But we often have the best arsenal to do it, we just don't have the courage to let them fly. So, I think we should start, when we can agree enough to move forward. What it's named, I don't think is as important anymore. What it's leadership is - I think it needs clear leadership. If it's multifaceted, one person can't do this, can't do that - it does need some faces - but it needs faces that aren't easily marginalized. Which is hard, honestly. It must be an organization that explicitly keeps vision and leadership and control with God-fearing Christians. It needs a symbol. It needs trademarking. It needs initial educaiton materials that are academically rigorous but also kind of the video that will go viral. And [it] needs language that's agreed upon, that is modest. This is the problem of trying to be relevant, and the risk of marginalization or being specific.

Natural law langauge... That dog don't hunt, y'all. Unless you're going to be in the ghetto of Roman Catholic thought, it just doesn't work well. In the quarters of academia, natural law's not accepted. I [know of an] ethicist that was kicked out; he was encouraged to go to a different program to finish his Ph.D., because no one would support a natural law dissertation. It's respected in specific Roman Catholic and specific Protestant circles, and there's some kind of quasi-Orthodox positions that are similar, but I don't think a robust natural law language will accomplish the desire. Just like Cass' {45:34 name?} language - {Cass} didn't win. Natural law language and {Cassian} language has been around. It's been marginalized; it hasn't won. I vote for a much more bold, particular language of saying, "This is based on a Christian vision of a Hippocratic medicine. Others are welcome to join us, if you agree to the following modest proposals..." If you include gender reassignment, it ain't done. Because there's such an active, violent reaction, I can tell you that health systems are getting probed for those cases. There would be any discrimination against someone seeking gender reassignment. They want cases. It hasn't happened as much since Trump has been elected. But, prior to that, it was fishy, it was obvious.

I think specific Christian language that doesn't call upon a presuppositionalist {46:40 indistinct} reformed tradition, or a natural law Roman Catholic position, or... I could go on and on and on, over the different approaches to apologetics. I would say we just have a modest Christian language that states things as they are. Then, I think, there has to be a coalition for dissemination of ideas and progress. This includes getting literature out there quickly. I mean, flooding. I encourage literature to be bold. Creating a literature, playing the same game as the evidence-based people are, creating our own definitions of "health" and why they are not met. It is a resistance.

That's all I had to say.

*** [2-47:40] Comment 4.1

In terms of structure, all the different organizations say, "We're part of this," but then, how do you run it? How do you govern it? That kind of thing - I think as we move forward in thought we need to give a lot of thought to the legal... [to] what kind of structure would work, to incorporate CMDA and AAPLOG and these pediatricians and everybody. How would we structure this so that everyobdy feels like they're winning?

*** [2-48:34] Speaker 4

I suggest something that would be, maybe, akin to the American Board of Ethics for Specialties {48:38 name?}, where you have an umbrella group. I'm afraid, if any one organization took this on... AAPS, which I've known as the libertarian opt-out, the kind of gadfly in medicine that is pretty small and says specific political things - AAPS can't become this, and AAPLOG can't become this. None of the organizations... I mean, I thought maybe CMDA could - it's been around and it does a specific thing. It's more like Campus Crusade for Christ in medical schools. Let it be what it is. Use them in an organizational way instead of saying, "Hey, we're going to say that this is the Gospel and this is the theological correctness that we're going to have for students," let's say, "Hey, all you people that are interested in these concerns, let's get this information out." And you can keep your silo, but let's just have the silos coalesce in a big way-station, and let's get a train going through it, and put some things on the train station. Let's get some movement, so it goes out of the silo, as well, and you can benefit from others. So, I would see [it] as an umbrella organization, but not having authority over those other organizations; being a standalone organization that invites dissemination, and one of its missions as an organization is to bring a coalition of partner organizations under it to help disseminate form and help disseminate information. I don't know if that works - legal...

*** [2-50:35] Comment 4.1

I don't know. I think that's part of what we should think about, because if you're going to form a website, you're going to seek grant funding so that we can actually do something, then you have to be something, you have to be legally incprorated. Tt has to say who's running it and all that kind of thing. In order to move ahead, I think you really need some infastructure, and I would like to move ahead, like, twenty years ago. I have a bee in my bonnet to see this happen over the next few years. So, I just want to get some feedback about infastructure, and how it would work.

*** [2-51:09] Speaker 4

I think you're right. I mean, two years is generous. I think that's about the time frame before we won't have an opportunity to do it. I would say that there may be mechanisms - I can't give legal advice - there may be mechanisms to get things started as the organization is being particularized - but I don't know the details of that.

*** [2-51:48] Comment 4.2

Is there anyone here from the CMDA leadership? Because they have the Freedom to Care Coalition, which sounds similar to what you're describing. That might be one place to start.

*** [2-51:53] Comment 4.1

Freedom to Care sort of started as a coalition, but it's kind of under CMDA. It's a CMDA thing that other people can join. I think if we had an AAPLOG thing that other people can join, it would be mutual. If we can structure it somehow that it's not any one of us, but we all feel like we all have equal say... you know, just something that everybody feels like they win.

*** [2-52:34] Comment 4.3

I have some concern that you may be marginalizing us right from the start. Hippocrates was not Christian. Some of the early leaders in medicine were not Christian. Christ said, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations." So why are we circling the wagons and drawing into ourselves and saying that if you're not Christian, if you're not a believer in what Christ wants us to do, you don't belong in our organization at all?

*** [2-53:24] Speaker 4

I didn't say that.

*** [2-52:26] Comment 4.3

Sounds like it. What's the base? You say the natural law is not accepted, but it is universal. The Ten Commandments, on the other hand, are often regarded these days by most of society as the Ten Suggestions. Where is our foundation, if not in spreading the concept of the natural law, and that we are all, as the Chicago Declaration says, worthy human beings, and deserving of the best medical care? That we, as physicians, ought to be providing the best of medical care to whomever, whoever we are, whatever religion we follow - as long as we follow the natural law. We need to make that acceptable, because I don't think we're ever going to get the Ten Commandments accepted universally.

*** [2-54:30] Comment 4.4

Well, the Ten Commandments, the Decalogue, is part of the natural law, arguably.

*** [2-54:34] Speaker 4

I never said that membership would be excluded. I'm saying that that discipleship that Christ called for changes reality. It changes the person. And I would only want in leadership those who are god-fearing Christians. That it may, in a functionalist way, be expanded to non-Christians and non-God-fearing Christians, I think may be acceptable, and is a compromise I'm willing to make. Even though I think there's something distinct that could be Christian medicine, I'm not optimistic that we would find agreement in the context of the United States [about] what [that] is.

As for the natural law, there's a whole history of philosophy that challenges natural law. Most of those challenges are more accepted in the secular society than natural law [is]. There are a lot of religious groups that don't accept natural law, including Orthodox Christianity, fundamentalist Protestants, [and] presuppositionalist Reformed. That we define nature [as] fallen is a challenge of the natural law. There's a penchant of natural law theorists to say something, to state something that they assume is self-evident. It's not self-evident to those that are not formed by the same rules of evidence, by the same authority of God, by the same understanding, and the rites and rituals of the people. I understand that there's a long tradition of Roman Catholics, and some Protestants, furthering a natural law theory so they become relevant in a secular world; I just don't buy that it's been very successful. I can't sign off on anything that's natural law. I can't. I CAN sign off on {56:31 indistinct} language that said, "We define health as being the furthering of this..." If you [add], "...by evidence," "...by the natural law," I have to say, why can't we stop the theory just a couple words earlier? Then it becomes far more inclusive of Christians that may say, "I've read natural law philosophers that further all kinds of evil, according to their natural law. I want to know what God says. What's God say? That's it. Done. I don't need to explain it philosophically." That's my concern about using specific natural law language. I think [among certain] groups, academic organizations, that that language is very safe, and people know what is meant by it. But outside of that circle, I don't think [it]'s as helpful. I would argue for much more modest language, that doesn't call upon - it calls upon a loose Hippocratic tradition. Hippocrates was not Christian, but there was a very known, very tangible Hippocratic Christian tradition. I do nthink there are differences between the Hippocratic Jewish, Islamic, and non-Hippocratic traditions. That's why I am suggesting that somewhere the organization make a comment that it's informed by the Christian Hippocratic tradition. Now, it can allow, it can have as an outpouring of that, people that want to sign off on whatever profession that is made. I think that's fine.

*** [2-58:19] Comment 4.5

I'll be very quick. I'm a resident, and I started Conscience in Residency, which is an organization - we've now filed for LLC in Missouri. We have a flashy website, we make flashy videos, and I've networked with several dozen medical students and residents, helping to do these things and find programs and be safe. I'm happy to help. [That's] point number one. My point number two is, just with a medical students, we'll have to be careful about how we help them with events, because a lot of them are very isolated. They move through their years very quickly. It might be easier to help them do events in {58:51 indistinct} model. But I'm happy to help in whatever way I can, figuring out ways to do things with students and with {58:58 indistinct}.

*** [2-58:59] Speaker 4

I think {59:00 indistinct} has been very good. I haven't paid much attention outside of [my own school], they put on a very good debate every year. The national organization gives the formation for debate, helps organize it. That way, students just kind of help pick a topic and get experience. They have a national conference at the beginning of the year to train the student leadership. I'm impressed by this organization. I've met the leadership of it. I think they may be natural partners, and a good model. I think even more... saying we have far specific aims than {59:40 indistinct}. I think they may be a good partner. Thank you.

** transcript 3.1 DONE
*** [3-00:00] Speaker 2

<Speaker 5> is a member of the American Association of Pro-Life OB/GYNs, and we've been in conversation for a long time about the topic of training and certification and survival of doctors who want to train and to practise without killing their patients.

*** [3-01:13] Speaker 5

So, I'm not exactly sure why I am here. My two claims to infamy are, one, that I am board certified, and I did serve on the certification board of the DO {01:26 unsure} OB/GYN college for five years back in the 1980s and early 1990s; and two, <Speaker 2> asked me. {personal details}

Ss I was preparing this, I thought that there are probably more ways than one to skin a cat, so, what I am going to present to you is kind of a take off of a little story that I heard one time.

A very righteous man died and went to Heaven and got to the pearly gates, and Saint Peter was there and said, "You lived a very good life, and you can get into Heaven today, but you have to answer three questions." He said, "Oh, I didn't know that I would have to take a test. I'm not prepared. I didn't know. I've never heard of anything like that." [The] first question was: "Name the two days of the week that begin with the letter 'T'." He said, "Oh, that's easy: 'today' and 'tomorrow'." Saint Peter said, "Well, that's not exactly what I was thinking of, but it fits the bill. The second question is: how many seconds in the year are there?" And he said, "Oh, twelve." Saint Peter said, "Twelve??" "You know: January second, February second, March second..." Saint Peter said, "Well, okay, that kind of fits the bill, and answers the question. The third one's a little bit more difficult: What's God's name?" He says, "Oh, it's Howard." "Howard?? How did you come up with Howard??" He said, "You know: 'Our father who art in Heaven, Howard be thy name...'"

We're looking at - as I summarize this - do we want to start a new board, or do we want a new designation, or do we want a new society? You already heard a little bit about what that society is. I'm going to give you a little bit of history about what we currently have. The American Board of Medical Specialties consists of 24 boards. They were all founded by their respective specialties, and their purpose was to assess and certify doctors who demonstrate clinical judgment skills and attitudes that are essential for the delivering of excellent patient care. So far, so good. The member boards answer the public call to establish uniform standards for physicians to achieve and maintain board certification. They're NOT membership societies. If we're going to form a board, we have to kind of... I'm a realist and a pragmatist; I don't want to re-invent the wheel, and I'll mention some things in relationship to some of the comments that <Speaker 4> made at the end, because I didn't get a chance to make a comment. Since I have the podium, I can make the comment. We need to think about, do we want to start all over again, do we want to mirror something else that already exists, or just exactly what [do] we want to do?

All the current boards are physician-led, they're not for profit, and they're independent evaluation organizations that all have accountability to the profession and the public. Their governing bodies are all salaried employees of the boards, and they each comprise specialists that are qualified in many fields, each comprising representatives from among national specialty organizations, even in related fields - so as an OB/GYN, we've now diversified into urogynecology and maternal fetal medicine and GYN oncology. All of those people are on the board for OB/GYN.

*** [3-05:01] various

<indistinct question>

*** [3-05:06] Speaker 5

They focus on constant education, and so, as was mentioned a few times already, education is a key. Part of that education needs to be an education of the public, because the public's not even aware of what board certification means in relationship to most of what we do. Yhese groups - the American Board of Medical Specialties - do participate in national initiatives on innovations on healthcare delivery. In other words, they're involved in politics. They have a lobby, they are in Washington, they spend a lot of money, they have a lot of money they're influencing, and [they're] lobbying politicans to make things happen. Board certifications started in 1917. There was a total of 24 by 2002. There was a response to the {05:56 indistinct} in 1910, that helped distinguish physicians who were trained by apprenticeship and those that had a more formal scientific training. It's different than the Royal Colleges in the UK and Canada. Their boards are all part of societies, and ours are not. They're independent of membership societies, and it is important to set high standards to the public. The American Board of Internal Medicine came about in 1936 and was put together by a coalition of the AMA and the ACP. The true constituency is the public, who desire transparency and accountability. That's who you really have to answer to. There is an underlying theme that I'll talk about in a few minutes. It was originally voluntary, but now it is considered to be mandatory. It was originally considered to be a mark of excellence, an extra professional achievement, and I think if we be focussed on the excellence part and the professional achievement part, and take bits and pieces from some of these things that are already out there, that it would stead {07:08 unsure} us well in what it is that we want to do.

Board certification evolved from a consumer movement in healthcare, but as I said, most of the public doesn't know what it means. They don't know the difference between board-certified and non-board-certified. They don't look at your diplomas on your wall. Your certification - if you have only one, like me - is framed. Well, you don't have [it] in every room in your office, you just have it in one place. It really grew tremendously as a result of hospital-based medicine and the need for more technical care. [It] led to credentials where hospitals needed to have some sort of criteria to evaluate and decide whether or not they were going to give you privileges.

So, recertification began in 1972. So it's not all that old, but it's old enough. Anyone that was certified before 1994 got grandfathered in and didn't have to go through the maintenance recertification process to become recertified.

All the boards now agree on MoC (Maintenance of Certification), which requires that your certification is limited to 6-10 year cycles, and they have four elements that are necessary for that recertification: that you had an active, unrestricted license where you practise; that you have enough self-evaluation of knowledge and increase in strength and standards for continuing medical education, including the ability to demonstrate significant learning; that you have a secure closed-book examination of knowledge; and the last thing that they added, which is the newest one and the most controversial one, the one that everybody is trying to go against, is the assessment of performance and practise. Because they're actually going to take the results and the outcomes of your treatment of your patients from your electronic medical records and make a decision as to whether or not your care is resulting in better outcomes. In the future, your maintenance of certification will be co-dependant on that.

The American Board of Internal Medicine has just one of those 24 boards, and I singled them out because most of that information was readily avilable on the internet. They use their own tools, called PINs (Practise Improvement Modules), which are internet-based, and they are related to national guidelines, and information is sent from the physician's office to the ABIM on a secure link to be analyzed. Part of the electronic medical records system is that your practise, performance, and your outcomes - and that's irrespective of whether or not your patients are complying - and irrespective of complications which occur even if you practise the best medicine in the world - bad things happen - and so, they're gonna look at your outcomes, and make a determination without having the details, other than what you've put into the record. It's no longer discretionary, and consumers and payers - mostly payers - are increasingly interested in evidence of your competence and [the] quality of care that you provide. Now, almost everywhere you go, hospital privileges are dependent on your board certification, and even residents that are coming out of residency training - that are coming on a staff at the hospital as a new associate for a group - have a specific, limited period of time before they become board-certified, or their privileges are rescinded. They get temporary hospital privilges, at least in Philadelphia area.

Originally, and [still] for some people, perpetual motivation is still the primary driver for certification. However, there's a lot of criticism of the process that's been going on, because the amount of time that it takes and the amount of money that it costs to get recertified. The important thing that I outlined here in red is that these boards have absolutely no regulatory or legal status. It's all perception. They've created a perception which is going to be an onerous task for us to overcome. But they do impact the marketplace, and that's where the payers come in. We'll hear a little bit more about some of the payment issues a little bit later. Originally, [their] value was an important initial step in professional development. But as practices change over time, there's going to be a need to understand these changes, and overlapping scopes of practice among different specialties. We're talking about different models of healthcare now; we're talking about home-based healthcare, we're talking about using physician extenders... all those things are going to complicate the issue of those that are just in the office practicing medicine one-on-one with their patients and don't use eletronic medical records. [I]n my practice I was so dead-set against the electronic medical records - [it] was only being mandated by medicare; we didn't have to do it. So what if they cut our medicare? An OB/GYN practise - it was only 5% of our income. It was an irrelevancy to me. But, for the three and a half years that I was tortured with it, for three different systems, it didn't improve my care at all, and it ticked off a lot of people, and it ticked me off. Because, I was answering emails at eleven o'clock at night, with patient questions coming through the patient portal, that I used to get paid for when they came into the office with the same complaints.

We need to build better relationships. The importance of patients is to build relationships, and so that's an important aspect that we need to look at if we're going to go forward with forming a new board. We need to have sensitivity to their needs and concerns. What is it that the consumer wants? Because this was originally consumer-driven. I don't know how much impact we can have as far as the payers are concerned. There's going to be different integrated systems of care that are going to come up in the future, and where can we fit into those systems of care? I've noticed in one of the last areas in the country - the northeast - it's like herding cats with physicians. Very few people are owned {13:51 uncertain} by hospitals, but more and more private practices are being purchased by a hospital. One particular hospital, St. Mary's Medical Center - 80% of the primary care practises in the Bucks County area that serves about 400,000 people were purchased by the hospital. The reason why they were purchasing primary care practices is because now they own the HMO; they own the lives. They can direct where they go and where they're capitated and where they need to go for X-ray and lab and things like that. The hospital gets all that feeding back into it. They only own one specialty practise, one OB/GYN practise. There's 23 OB/GYNs in the department. [I know of] an OB/GYN in Cleveland, and he just gave up his practice to become a laborist at Cleveland Clinic, and he makes a better salary and benefits than he did when he was in private practise working three 12 hour shifts a week. It's very attractive as one gets older and [is] looking at retirement. We have to buck that trend a little bit, and that's one of the forces that are going against us. You all know what criteria are necessary for certification. You go to medical school; serve a 3-5 year residency that is an approved, accreditted program, by another accrediting organization that says your residency is approved; you have to get letters of attestation from the program director; get a nonrestrictive license; and pass a written and oral examination. [In] the DO certifying board, [they] actually had to go out around the country [and] examine people. and observe them doing surgery, and certify them. They had to do a hysterectomy and one other major surgery. Two examiners went in, and the applicant had to pay for the airfare and the transportation accomidations for the examiners to come in. They have all of their charts available, and medical records pulled, and categorized by diagnosis and procedure. And then, make sure that [they] had enough cases on the OR. When [they] went to the OR, [the board members] watched them do the surgery, and could tell whether or not they were doing a good job, and then went back to the board and voted on whether or not they were going to be certified. In addition to the written and the oral [exams]. They've since done away with the practical exam. It sounds like it was a little ridiculous, but it was the system at the time.

Some of the obstacles, if we form this new certifying board, [are] that we're going to be competing with long-standing organizations that are well-recognized, at least professionally. We're going to compete with already-existing boards that are that have approved residencies, competency testing, recognition by the major organizations that have big lobbies and control all of the money and all the strings; and we're going to compete at a hospital level with standards for privileges. To establish this new organization, we would need... As all of you obviously know, if you're going to practice, you need an office, a staff, financing, a board of governance, and committees to establish standards; you would need marketing, as you've heard, for physicians, and the public, and hospitals; [you would need] a website and a market presence; and you would need to establish yourself, to give credibility with insurance companies. You may not immediately be paid, depending on where you are and what kind of insurances exist. Who knows how it's going to change in the near future, depending on what happens.

We also are competing against the redefinition of the Hippocratic Oath. We call ourselves a society of Hippocratic medicine; there are people that are going to turn around and say, "Well, you know, the Hippocratic Oath has been changed by so many schools that only 8% of the medical schools in the United States actually take the original Hippocratic Oath. The other schools take the Osteopathic Oath. Some people take the Oath of Maimonides. Some take the Declaration of Geneva. And more than half use a modified version." So, we use this word, "Hippocratic"; WE all know what it means, and WE all know what it intends and portends, but out there in the culture, where people are looking at, you know, this school sa[ys] it's okay to give up abortifacients, and this one says it's not, and this one [doesn't] even take that oath. We really need to think about whether or not we want to use that word. I was kind of against it in December, and then I kind of got for it, a little bit, when I was thinking about it; but now I'm not so sure. I just think that we really need to think - not for a real long period [of] time, but we really need to think hard about what it is that we want to call this organizaiton. We're going against a body that's 80 years old, that has 37 specialties, 86 sub-specialties. There are 860,000 active, certified physicians in the United States, and 520,000 of them are currently engaged in maintenance of certification. Only 13% of all physicians in the United States are not board-certified and could give a flying hoot. There was an article recently in one of our local journals about an 83 year old founding physician in upstate Pennsylvania who was the only doctor in town who's having her license looked upon by the State of Pennsylvania, because she doesn't have electronic medical record, she doesn't participate with any insurance company. She charges $50 for an office visit. She does holistic medicine. Everybody loves her. Nobody hates her. She's board certified in family medicine, but she doesn't pay her dues and she doesn't get recertified, and so Pennsylvania's going to take her license away. Not because she's old! She'd have a good discrimination suit if... So, I don't know what she's going to do. But these are the threats and some of the obstacles that we're going to face.

I took one example [from] the American Board of Internal Medicine, and their financial numbers from 2016: They had an income of $62.5 million. 54% of that was for certification, and 45% of it was for maintenance of certification. 1% was for "other". You can see the breakdown there. And they spend 18% of that $62 million to develop the exam. I think any computer [could] do that in a relatively short period of time with a database of medicine from medical schools and internships and residencies and things like that. Be that as it may, you can see that physician support - a lot of this goes to salaries.

With the new consideration, do we want a new certification? Do we want to be diplomats of another organization? Or, do we want a new society? Do we want to be the American Board of Medical Ethics? Or, do we want to be the American Board of Ethical Medicine? Is that different than Hippocratic medicine? As was mentioned, we need a name, mission statement, purpose statement, vision statement, and a definition of standards. Again, I'm not against reinventing the wheel. <Speaker 2> asked the question. I have to say I was listening to <Speaker 4>, [and] this is kind of my interjection. There are bits and pieces of all the things that <Speaker 4> mentioned in all of the other organizations that he listed. Catholic Medical Association [has] a student section [with] 260 medical students from around the country, a resident section with 180 residents, their own websites, their own Google Hangouts, and their own reporting systems. [They] have a mentoring system where they can hook up on their electives with authentically Catholic positions in any specialty. If they have to do an EMT rotation, or a family medicine rotation, [they] have a list of the names of all the physicians that are willing to take students in their office and mentor them, and they can go live with them for the month, so they're not only housed, but they share their families and their family life and their social life, and go to church with them, that they can go to the office and the hospital with them. Every year [they] have a boot camp [at] Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia, with about 30, 40 students that come in on scholarship, and they get one week of immersion in authentic Catholic healthcare in almost every specialty, from specialist[s] traveling from around the country on their own dime to give them that.

I think putting together the leaders of all of those organizations in one room - not a big room, like this, but if you have 12 organizations, 12 of those leaders, that know the history and know the workings of all those organizations, and had a list of needs, and say, "We have one of those. We can use that." "We have one of THOSE. We can use THAT."... Another model that I can mention [regarding] how this is going to work [is] the CMA. [They] have the national organization, but [they] have 101 guilds. Each of them are their own 501(c)(3), and they function in their own particular area, but they all filter back up and feed up and are members of the national organization. [The CMA] give[s] them the mission statement, the vision statement, the logo, [and] the guild documents to get their guild started. They have to have their own physicians, they have to do their own fund-raising. If this big umbrella organization could bring in all these other organizations, like CMDA, CMA, AAPS, and all these others that have like-mind and like-spirit, you would get 20 or 30 or 40 thousand potential members immediately, without them changing their parent organizations. They can still be their own independent functional organizations, but contribute with whatever pieces of that puzzle that you're looking for that you need to put together to have that big coalition, to bring everybody together. Kind of like the United States government, only <indistinct> states, but a little bit happier and getting along a little bit better.

We need an application process. We need a certificate process, marketing, we need somebody to review all that, we need to create that process. I thought, well, maybe we'll call it the Society of Ethical Medicine, and after your MD or your DO, you can have the letters SEM, and you can sign your certificate, and you'd be a member of the Society of Ethical Medicine, and people would ask you, "What is that society? What do they do? Don't the other doctors practise ethical medicine?" "Well, not the way that WE practise ethical medicine! Let me tell you about it." I had the same issue in my practice, but I converted my practice - I was a fully contracepting OB/GYN, a Roman Catholic, but then, 20 years ago, I had a conversion, through a experience with a Catholic priest - I won't bore you with the details - and I converted my practice to NFP-only, and people would come in and say, "What's natural family planning? What's NFP?" And I would say, "Well, I can teach you. Do you want to hear about it? Do you want to know about?" I had stuff all over the office. I had the initials after my name. Certified Natural Family instructor. So, people would ask. Something like that may bring some close market.

There are a couple of alternatives that I found in my research. One of them is the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons, committed to providing certification that ensures physician compliance with national standards and promote life-long learning. It's $169 a year, it's a 15-minute application. They currently have 6,000 diplomats. They are becoming recognized by multiple hospitals throughout the United States, and it is an up-and-coming and growing alternative, already in existence, to the certification process, and they're already being recognized by some insurance companies throughout the country. Prior to the formation of this organization, which just came into existence in 2014, there was some controversy surrounding the requirements for continued certification in medical specialty, and a lot of the things that were being proposed at that time by the APMS - practice assessment, patient safety activities - really did not provide optimal use of physicians' time. And there was no quality data - talk about evidence-based medicine - there's absolutely no quality data at all that justifies these activities for maintenance of certification. The amount of money, the amount of time that's involved... They feel that they have the metrics to provide, that would satisfy and justify requirements for maintaining their hospital staff privileges.

In January 2014, the American Board of Maternal Medicine changed its certification policies for physicians. Instead of being listed as "board-certified", you're [now] listed as "certified, meeting maintenance of certification requirements", or "certified, NOT meeting maintenance of certification requirements". There's an ongoing engagement in various knowledge practice assessment and patient safety activities, that's assessed every 2 years. There was an article in the New Englang journal of medicine, in January 2015, by Paul Tearson, who is the founder of the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons, who said, his personal frustration in trying to fulfill the new MoC requirements "ultimately led me to create a web-based petition that now has more than 19,000 anti-MOC signatures, and contains thousands of comments against the new MOC requirements." You can see the website if you're interested. A recent second petition with 6,000 signatures advocates taking a pledge of noncompliance with the requirements. So, there's a whole other group of physicians out there that are not coming from where we're coming from, but are not happy with their certification requirements. So they can come into the boat. When you're talking about Christ, and talking about all the groups of different peoples - the Jewish people, the Gentiles, and the Samaritans - they were all coming into the fold from everywhere, because they were moved by his charisma and what he had to say. It's really going to be about what we have to say. 

In addition to the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons, there is an American Academy of Medical Ethics, and I took this right from their website. This is chaired by Dave Stevens, who is the CEO of CNBA. Shame that nobody's here from that organization. Their mission is to promote the interest of medical educators, medical practitioners, and scientists; the care and the wellbeing of patients; the protection of public health; and the betterment of the medical profession. As well as to protect and promote the historical values that have provided the long-standing foundation for Western healthcare. Their vision is that "We foresee the standard of healthcare in North America being once again defined by the Hippocratic tradition." Sound familiar? Sound like something that we have been talking about? So, physicians - and this is part of their mission statement, on their website - "physicians must respect all human life and must not intentionally take life, that is, must not take the life of the unborn, and must not perform euthenasia, and must not provide assistance for suicide. What we do, we serve patients, healthcare professionals and our culture by serving as an ethical voice to speak to the government, media, church and public on ethical issues facing healthcare. We offer resources that you can educate yourself and others about important isssues affecting healthcare professionals and patients." We said we needed literature, white papers, information, educational handouts... "We fight against the legalization of physician-assisted suicide through grassroots efforts in states across the country. We arrange and conduct educational conferences, speeches, interviews, and research into fields of ethics, medicine, and science. We teach traditional values through scholarly endeavours, and we network healthcare professionals who share these values." To quote Dave Stevens, "Education is the key to understanding, and without it, truth is compromised. Experience has shown us how quickly legalized and assisted suicide becomes euthenasia, where a physician not only writes the prescription for the lethal drugs, but administers them. Within four years after Washington state legalized physician assisted suicide, a Washington lawyer began pushing for euthenasia, for those who were not terminally ill - which shows how dangerours legalizing physician assisted suicide really is." The American Association of Medical Ethics has a state director in [all] 50 states of the United States {32:17 indistinct}. If you go on this website, you can see who the state director is in your individual state. It may be somebody you know, and you can contact them and talk about it.

These are their values: "We subscribe to the traditional values of the Hippocratic Oath, which include the practise of medicine involving covenants with Deity, patients, students, teachers, and colleagues." Notice that they capitalize the word "Deity", but do not specifically mention the Deity, which is not the Greek gods, and not any other gods, but a Deity. You kind of have the open window to interpret that, if you are of a belief other than Christian. "Physicians must be trustworthy, they must always seek their patients' best interests, they must not exploit their patients or caregivers, they must practise within their capabilities, they must practice the standard of care, they must respect all human life, [they] must not intentionally take life, they must maintain confidentiality, they must seek justice and avoid injustice and discrimination, and they must be accountable for their actions." And they have a pretty spiffy website. All this is already put together in there.

Recently, a Texas hospital physician staff voted at their medical staff meeting to remove the Maintenance of Certification requirements, and the hospital denied that vote. [They] said, "Nope, you can't do away with that, you're continue on using it if you wanna keep your privileges." As a result of that, two MD respresentatives in the House introduced a bill to prevent Texas medical board from using MoC as a requirement for obtaining and renewing a medical license. Ultimately, beyond privileges, and beyond payment, our licenses come from the state. They don't come from an organization, they don't come from a board, they don't come from the Federal government, they come from the state. Whether you want to be politically involved or not, if it comes down to the point where they have enough clout from the other organizations to impact what's going on in states, then they can make new licensure requirements that will impact your potential to get relicensed. I don't know - I tried to research - I don't know that there's any other alternative to licensing. Certification, certainly, but licensing...

The MoC takes physicians away from patient care, it costs time, it costs money - there are many objections to the process - there's a lack of clinical relevance, there's a lack of evidence that shows that it impacts the outcome of healthcare, there are fees - the average cost is $1,846, the highest was $3,000 (for the American Association of Allergists and Immunologists) and the cheapest was $985. There are 14 boards out of the 24 that require an oral, closed-book exam, and a mean cost for that is $1,694. Who are we making rich? Between the cost of your license, the cost of running your practice, the cost of malpractice insurance, the cost of your association and your professional organizations... [I know of a DO who] was required to maintain [their] board certification to be a member of the ALA and the PLMA (Pennsylvania Osteopathic Medical Association). They were requirements to maintain board certification. [They] had to pay the $800 a year to the national organization, whether [they] agreed with them or not, and the $600 to the state organization, whether [they] agreed with them or not. There's 22,000 physicians that have already signed a petition to recall MoC, and some people, some physicians and healthcare professionals, are looking for a society maintaince {36:34 indistinct}, and so that may be part of this formation of the new society, potentially, rather than a new board. And, as I mentioned, there are no difference in quality outcomes among MOC compared to those with time-unlimited certificates. If you get grandfathered in, [you] could practice in a state equal with all of [your] partners who are getting recertified every six to ten years; [you] could run circles around them in the OR with surgery and techniques and things that they never saw, and never heard of, and never knew; and provide excellent quality care. [You'd] just [have to] get [your] CMEs to maintain your requirements.

Wrapping up, John Patrick is a professor up in Ottawa. I heard him at the Canadian Christian Medical and Dental Society 2 years ago when [some organizations] were fighting the battle against euthenasia and physician-assisted suicide, and a quote that I took from him is: "We must talk about the necessity of transcendence, of a commitment to the sanctity of life, to training with moral ethos, and to the critical importance of the preservation of the moral integrity of the physician, even over illegitimate claims [regarding] patient autonomy, if medicine and the doctor-patient relationship are to be preserved." And that, I think, is the focus and the direction that we need to emphasize. There are many writers that have compared our times to the sack of Rome. Alistar Mcintire said, "And if the tradition of the virtues was able to survive the horrors of the last dark ages, we are not entirely without grounds for hope. This time however the barbarians are not waiting beyond the frontiers; they have already been governing us for quite some time. And it is our lack of consciousness of this that constitutes part of our predicament. We are waiting not for a Godot, but for another - doubtless very different - St. Benedict."

So, will qualifying bodies accept what we do? That remains to be seen. The value of the new option, to me, is completely unclear, because I'm not sure what hospitals and insurers are going to do. Dr. Stone in his interview in that New England Journal of Medicine article that this is a grassroots movement that will grow in acceptance relatively rapidly, and he stated that because of the widespread outpouring of support - we've received an alternative [to] MoC - he thinks that now is the time. There are a bunch of other physicians who, for various and different reasons, may be willing to look at alternative. As I mentioned, there were 20,000 physicians that have signed the online petition.

There was some caution, however, that if we switch, we have to be careful. Westby Fisher, an internist at Northshore University Health System in Glenvue Illinois, and a clinical assoiate professor of medicine at University of Chicago, told Medscape Medical News that if we're going to look at an alternative certification, we should look before we leap. He applauds the new board's (the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons) plan, but he says it will not pass scrutiny under the current Affordable Care Act. It will not pass scrutiny under Medicare. So, you may lose affiliation if you go in a different direction, unless we nail that down. He explains his reasoning in a recent blog post: "Unless it contains all those pieces outlined by ABMS - and they're the ones that outlined it in the current healthcare act - it will not be a legal entity; and until we change the law, any subsequent board that tries to replace the current system is not likely to succeed." Personally, after passing his MoC recertification three times, he's not going to pursue a 4th time after his current ten-year tenure runs out. He doesn't think the current proposal is a reliable alternative.

For discussion: do we form a committee to develop an outline based on what we're presenting here today, come up with some specific things that [were] mentioned by [Speaker 4] and [Speaker 3] in their previous talks, in three months or six months with some documents? How are we going to get funding? My son's an MBA in pharmaceutical finance and management, and he introduced me to the SWOT analysis: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. The strength of the current system is that it complies with all the current laws. The weakness is that it's costly and time-consuming and agenda-driven and non-Pro-Life. The opportunity for us is that we can create a new system, or a document, or a society, or a pledge - start out small and go bigger, [or] start out with the nuclear bombs and drop them all over, as was previously mentioned, creat[ing] a mini mass annihilation of the current system. The threat is that we could lose our privileges, we could lose some income, we may even lose our license. And we all live under a threat.

I have nothing more to add. <laughter> I don't have an answer for it. I mean, as I said, I'm a pragmatist. I'll reinvent the wheel. I think that the pieces are our there - pieces from AAPLOG and ACPeds - and somebody needs to put them all together and funnel them up into an institution, maybe base it out [of] a medical school that already has a faculty, already has certification, already has some other things that we need to go with it, - sit down with some faculty members - and then go and run it from there.

*** [3-43:04] Comment 5.1

If I could just add two things: before December 3 last year, I talked to the director of NBPAS, and he is not Pro-Life, but he said, "We don't have any agenda other than good medicine, and we are happy to act as an umbrella organization." [He] allowed for certification. I said, "Our issue is, are you ever going to require assisted suicide, abortion, other kinds of things?" He said, "No, we're never going to require that." So, I want you to know that.

And, we have communicated with CMDA, it's just they have so many activities that they weren't able to come to [the] December 3 [meeting] or this meeting; and [another] other thing is, the National Board of Medical Ethics, I think, is under CMDA. So, again, it would be an issue of structuring it. It's a great organization, but it is under CMDA.

*** [3-44:19] Comment 5.2

If anybody has any doubts about any of this, let them be said <uncertain>.

From 1972 until now, all these boards had the opportunity to prove the worth of recertification. They are scientific organizations! They have staff! They could have done this. They did not. And they did not because they probably knew that they'd never be able to prove that it did any good. In fact, recent studies say - as you pointed out - it doesn't do any good. If anybody is concerned about the financial wellbeing of these organizations, I would recommend that they go onto GuideStar and look up the IRS form 990, and I can tell you, I don't know OB/GYN, I do know pediatric - the American Board of Pediatrics has over $40 million in the bank. They have a beautiful office in North Carolina, filled with expensive artwork and furniture. They lavish meals and trips and things on their boards that we could never consider. Their past CEO took home over $1 million a year. Now, there may be some people in OB/GYN that take home over a million dollars a year - there's nobody in pediatrics... <laughter>

*** [3-45:57] Speaker 5

I can assure you, nobody in OBGYN - the malpractise is $900,000.

<more laughter>

*** [3-46:03] Comment 5.2

So, you know, this is an organization I wish we had started, that we'd all be having all the executive staff that we need, being able to have meetings in exotic places, and not worry about the financing of any of it. Professional organizations, at least in pediatrics, lock step with the board, even if they're not part of the board. They provide education so that you can succeed in the LMC. They're making a great deal of money with that, to the point where the American Academy of Pediatrics this year has a profit of over $4 million.

*** [3-46:56] Speaker 5

My only response to that is, I went down and [saw] CMDA, because I wanted to see an organization [that] had 17,000 members and a $10 million a year budget, and they moved their offices from Texas to Bristol, Tennessee. Now, I don't know if you've been to Bristol, Tennessee, but there's really nothing in Bristol, Tennessee. They started out on the upper floor of a pharmaceutical warehouse that stored drugs, and [the CEO] had developed a personal friendship with [the] individual that owned that pharmaceutical warehouse, and he GAVE him the space. He was in family medicine and his executive vice president is an OB/GYN, and they met in the medical mission field in Kenya, and they worked together for about twenty years in the medical mission fields in Africa, and then they came back to the United States and decided to become part of this organization. He went out and got his MBA. He's the president and CEO. [It's not like] the Catholic Medical Association, [with] a board of 19 people argue[ing] things for ever and ever and ever - you can just imagine 19 Catholics in a room arguing over medicine and what to do about the organization. [The CEP] said that they had an ER doc from Texas that donated a million dollars to them, $100,000 a year for ten years. It was specifically to go to one of the 33 missions they do in 25 countries around the world. They have an organizational setup. They have a magazine, they have an annual conference, they have websites, they have all kinds of teaching and everything. In fact,  [the Catholic Medical Association gets their] CMEs for [their] programs from them, because [they] can't get them from other secular hospital systems and educational organizations, because [they're] the Catholic Medical Associatin, so a lot of [ther[ talks have to do with the spiritual aspects of medicine and healthcare, and wholeness of the person, and integrity of the person, and things like that. [They] just had [their] meeting in Denver three weeks ago, and had record attendance of 705 attendees.

There is a hunger, there is a need, and I think the point was made earlier that now may be the time, because there is a rumbling, and there's a lot of disruption, there's a rage, there's an anger, there's a sentiment, and we do outnumber the barbarians at the gate. We really do. But we just can't be satisfied with staying at home and living in our little worlds that we've created that are safe and comfortable... My wife said to me, "You're retired. Why are you going to Chicago, again?" I said, "Because they want me to talk about certification." "What do you know about certification?" I said, "Nothing, but I can talk." <laughter>

Before I start talking about Direct Primary Care, I just wanted to share, briefly, my personal professional experiences that make this conference seem so urgent to me.

After residency, 8 years ago, I joined a really prominent pediatric group in town that I thought I would fit in great, and I thought that everyone was like-minded, because almost everyone professed Christianity. But I soon found that my basic Biblical beliefs about sexuality and the value of life were not going to be tolerated. I tried to be very sweet and pleasant, and I was not obnoxious in any way, but I had a lot of pressure. For years, I was advised on the side by a very helpful lawyer from Liberty Counsel. [I] tried to just reason with everyone - "These are my personal beliefs. If there's some way I am going against evidence-based medicine, please show me." I tried to reason over time, "Look, I've encountered the pregnant teenager, I've encountered teenagers who are struggling with their sexuality, and nobodoy's complained. I've deal[t] with people sensitively, I'm not judgmental..." It was a lot of pressure over the years, but I was just trying to stick it out there. Then, at the beginning of last year, in our state through the school system, the transgender bathroom issue came up. It pretty much came to a hysterical point, [and] I was part of ACPeds, and ACPeds had submitted a letter saying why that was not in the best interest of school children. Then, a few months later, a group of all the prominent pediatric offices in town just kind of out of nowhere said, "We want to support a ban on conversion therapy, and if anyone doesn't agree, they need to speak up, or else we're going to just say that we're all in agreement with it." So, <Speaker 1> helped me write a very respectful letter, laying out the reasons why there's no scientific basis to exclude choice and therapy for sexuality issues. A few days later, I was in the job market again, even though I thought I was pretty secure, because I was a partner.

So, I had a few weeks of my life of really learning to trust God. I was really surprised that I was pretty much just shunned [by] the whole pediatric community after that letter. After a few weeks, God, in a really awesome way, connected me with <Speaker 7>, and with the Mark Blocker, the, CEO of Christian Healthcare Centers - [which] <Speaker 7> is going to talk about in a few minutes - and he said, "God put this on my heart years ago: to make a refuge for medical professionals." Which definitely made me cry, to know that God had a plan and a way that I could keep practicing medicine and didn't have to leave my home town.

So, what is Direct Primary Care? This is a model of medicine in which patients pay a membership fee to cover a scope of medical services. As it says in the name, usually it's talking about primary care, although some people use "DPC" in relation to specialists, and there's an increasing number of specialists operating by this kind of model. The average price across the country is $75 a month per membership, and this is an alternative system to the fee-for-service insurance billing model. Some people have called it concierge medicine for the masses, because it usually is affordable to middle class families. The membership fee is usally paid directly by the patient, although some employers will pay this or offer it as an option for their employees. In this type of model, physicians are working directly for their patients, not the insurance companies. Our CEO talks about it being like Amazon, Netflix, or Uber. You cut down your overhead by taking out the middle man. It's rapidly growing in the US. In 2005, there were only 146 DPC physicians, and now - there's a lot of different statistics - but it's at least thousands, across the US. Here's an example of one website that DPC offices can register on for free, and this shows 786 DPC offices across the nation. The only states that I'm not aware of offices in are the Dakotas.

There are 21 states who have favorable laws for direct primary care. Thankfully for us, Michigan is a really good state to do direct primary care in. Oregon is the only one that there's a lot of restrictions. If you go to a website called DPCfrontier.com, which is made by a DPC doctor who's also a lawyer, he has it so you can just click on each state to see what the status, legally, is in your state.

As far as benefits, we chose direct primary care for Christain Healthcare Centers mainly because of the additional time we gained by being third-party-free. The funding [is] often a source of control and manipulation. The majority of the mechanisms [that] the government uses to dictate how physicians practice medicine are tied to payment. Also, direct primary care removes the conflict of interest that is so rampant with insurance incentives and other things involved with a third payer system, and allows physicians just to focus on what is best for the patient sitting in front of you, without being distracted by all the quality measures and all of the documentation or other requirements that the third [party] payers want you to do.

Most DPC offices feel that they can get better patient care, and one reason is because the patient panels are often a third to a half of what a doctor would have on a traditional third [party] payer office. Again, the main reason is because you're cutting out the middle man. That means you can have longer visit times; our visits are typically 30-60 minutes, and that's much more conducive to relationship-building, and to really having that time to address your patients' spirit, soul, and body.

Another big benefit to us of Direct Primary Care, as financial stewardship, as Christians, [is that] practising medicine is much cheaper without insurance being involved. Nationwide, about 40% of office revenue typically goes to insurance-related expenses, as <Speaker 7> will talk about more. A lot of Direct Primary Care offices have labs and medications as part of the membership, and it has just blown our minds away, when you take insurance out, how much cheaper the labs and medications are. It's often a tiny fraction of what it would be if you were paying for it through a third [party] payer system. As a lot of other Direct Primary Care offices have done, we've negotiated rates for specialist services, for advanced testing, and lots of other benefits to patients to help keep cost down.

A DPC office is an especially great financial fit for patients with a healthcare sharing ministry. That's the biggest proportion of our members, a this point, and one reason <Speaker 7> will talk about more of Samaritan Ministries helping us. There's about one million Americans who have a health sharing ministry as their alternative for insurance. It's also a good financial fit for people with high deductible insurances, which is now what 29% of American employees have, and people that have no healthcare coverage otherwise.

<Speaker 2> has asked ed me to just talk about some of the challenges, so, it can be really difficult to talk to people and try to help them understand [that] there is life outside of insurance, there's different ways to do this. Most people who have the health sharing ministries, they tend to get it, like homeschool families who already tend to think outside the box; they're a lot of our patients who will get something like this a little easier. Another current challenge is that you can't use HSA dollars to pay for membership fees. But, there is proposed legislation right now - we hope that will change, because that would be a huge draw. And, the startup of a new office is, of course, financially challenging, especially if you don't have that insurance reimbursement coming in. And, kind of a sad part is if you're already in practice and you transition to Direct Primary Care, a lot of your patients don't often follow. The national average is like 4-6%. Some doctors will have a hybrid office where they'll take insurance from some patients, and then other patients pay a membership fee, or they'll transition like that for a few years.

*** [4-10:39] Speaker 7

Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, to talk.

I am an internist. I've been in practise for 11 years now, over in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I left a real and outstanding group. I didn't have the same experience as... we were considered to be the premier medical office in west Michigan, but we were convicted that there was a malaise and parasitic cancer in the healthcare industry.

We created Christian Healthcare Centers not as a reaction to the Affordable Care Act, but rather, as a reaction to the way third party interests were manipulating and, dare I say, prostituting healthcare. We know there needs to be a change, we know that the current system's not sustainable, and we needed to come up with a different healthcare delivery model that COULD be sustainable, and had other significant advantages along the way.

We are a not for profit organization. We are mission driven. Fortunately, I can actually blow through these slides, because it seems like the people in this room share our mission. We are focused on providing exceptional quality of care. I['ll] go into the definition of exceptional in a little bit. The way that third party payer systems - CMS, for profit - as well not for profit insurers determine quality now [is] based upon numeraical, quantifiable data. There is no real subjective qualifiable aspect, at least if you're talking in terms of reimbursement, which - let's be fair here - is the reason why we had ECQ {12:21 uncertain}; which is why we have PQRS - well, HAD PQRS. We are Biblically based; so, quality, for us, is defined based upon the way that Christ delivered care in the New Testament, and the way we were told to provide care in the Old Testament. It's pretty straightforward. The standards that we follow, in terms of the ethics in how we practise healthcare, [are] determined biblically.

Equitable healthcare. What does that mean? It doesn't just mean that it's affordable to everybody. People keep thinking about patient autonomy. Are we able to provide services that they choose to accept? I would argue that with the new technology that we're developing in healthcare with the consumerist attitude toward the healthcare product, if you will, patients are now feeling, unfortunately, justified in demanding services that, morally, a Christian indiavidual may not consider to be appropriate (or, culturally, is inconsistent with our values).

Operational values. <Speaker 3>'s article actually mirrors our own. We are a Christ-centered organization. We are committed to quality as defined by the patient and by God. We are a definitively, unabashedly, life-affirming organization. We were actually very heavily criticized by Christian organizations in Grand Rapids because we chose to put the word "Christian" at the front of our title. They said that we were creating an undue unecessary target for ourselves, subject to attack. I believe in the Holy Spirit. I believe that if were are truly making this His organization, I think we should give God some room for grace to work. So, we labelled ourselves the Christian Healthcare Centers very deliberately.

We are committed not just to our own membership, but to the community as a whole. We have been given a mission to be stewards of all of God's creation, not just our fellow believers. We are committed to public health. We are committed to public education - and we'll go a little bit more into that as to why we chose our corporate structure the way we did. We are faith healers, in that we believe that God is in fact the Great Physician. However, we are absolutely committed to outstanding quality of care as defined by our respective boards of specialty. We are a multi-specialty group. We intend to expand out even further to multiple subspecialties, but we do practice evidence-based medicine. We are committed to outstanding quality of care. Not just holistic care or naturalism, which reeks of animism, but I don't want to get into that discussion. We are holistic; we are are whole-person focused. We all know that the body, the flesh, is the first thing that gets put to death, which is why the care that we provide is focused also to tailoring itself toward emotive care, and spiritual care.

We are a 501.(c)(3), not for profit, tax-exempt organization. We spent literally a year debating, should we be for profit, not for profit, but for the reasons of charity and religion we opted - obviously - to be not for profit. The advantage of being a religious not for profit is we can act as a para-church organization, which fits with our mission and our values. We want to be able to provide care for the indigent, for the underserved, and obviously being a religiously exempt organization allows us to do so and remain mission-oriented. It also allows us to provide community-based education. However, as a religious organization, we can filter in the education that we provide to the public with what we would consider to be a more appropriate, more values-driven, and Christian-alligned perspective.

Now, a lot of you are probably sniggering at the next bullet point: legal protection. You know, precedent has been established. We have Catholic, Jewish, Baptist hospitals... There's been a lot of pioneering work done by the Christian community throughout the history of the United States, in healthcare, and at least for now, the government affords us some protection, either through precedent established historically, or by the fact that we are a 501.(c)(3). We all know that special interest organizations, [and] the government itself, is daily trying to destroy that protection that we're afforded, but for now, we want to try to take advantage of that to the best that we can.

We are a charitable organization because we believe that we are to be charitable with how we regard our fellow man. Right now, again, just like in the religion nomenclature, we [as an] organization are decidedly committed [to] caring for the indigent. We have set aside 10% of revenues to care for those who are underserved, indigent, etcetera. Currently, 3% of our membership do not pay for their membership. 7% of our members receive financial assistance. We basically use the same criteria that a lot of other organizations would do; we basically index it to 200% of Federal poverty level.

The real advantage, however, of being a not for profit, is that we have a board that keeps us mission-focused. It's not about saving money. You can structure your for-profit clinic as a PLC and LLC and you can shelter all that profitability by redistributing it to your providers. It's not about tax evasion or trying to avoid having to pay taxes. It's about, what are we doing with our business? What is it that we corporately want to accomplish with the resources that God gives to us? Being a not for profit organization allows us to exercise better stewardship, and use those resources for mission-based purposes, but it also gives us an opportunity, as <Speaker 6> described earlier - how do you start a Direct Primary Care office when you live and you die on your membership? <Speaker 8> here from Samaritan Ministries knows very well. Through his gift to us, and the fits of others, we were able to capitalize ourselves [for] start up in ways that for profit organizations cannot.

Brief review. <Speaker 6>'s already described some of the advantage of being a DCP, [and] I just went over the advantages of being a not for profit: being a not for profit allows us to be mission-focused, grants us some legal protection, and provides some foundation for us to move forward in a not for profit healthcare model. Capitalization stewardship opportunities that aren't afforded to other organizations with a different business model. Direct Primary Care... Again, if the mission is to preserve independence and allow us to practise according to our values, financial independence removes moral conflict of interest... Allows us to preserve the mission, allows us to practise our craft the way that God has intended us to do so.

This began out of discussion where we were lamenting the state of affairs in healthcare. Again, not exactly a reaction to the Affordable Care Act, however, we did know that we needed to create something that was novel, but most importantly, self-sustaining. There are several not for profit Christian clinics out there in the community that provide indigent care, that live and die based upon charitable givings. And while that's outstanding - that's great - we wanted something that didn't just provide care to the indigent, but care for all of God's people. We didn't want to create a flash in the pan that died when our benevolent donors decided to move on, or... move on. Which can happen. Obviously.

We spent over a year debating, how are we going to create the foundation, the business model for our practise? Ultimately, we decided not only a not for profit, but Direct Primary Care. Once we decided to do Direct Orimary Care, it was pretty remarkable how quickly things accelerated. Within six months (about two months ahead of schedule), our lawyers had told us that there were no not for profit religiously affiliated Direct Primary Care offices as of november 2013. Because of that, we were quite worried that we would encounter tremendous amounts of opposition from the IRS in giving us our (501.(c)(3) designation. They - praise the Lord - actually gave us approval about two months ahead of schedule. The moment that happened - as you can see placed on the timeline, we were incorporated and then we created our board almost immediately after. We were very specific [regarding] who we chose for our board membership. We didn't just try to target affluent individuals in the community who could help to finance and payroll our operations. We were very specific about selecting individuals who were either prominent in either legislation, the judiciary system, or who have been in the healthcare industry long enough to give us some guidance on how to navigate the malaise that is the executive and corporate aspects of healthcare. We identified our first clinic. Once we found our location, that's really when we started putting our feet on the gas and selecting our actual clinical staff. It took us probably about 18 months to find three physicians. We rejected about three times as many. That's not to say that these physicians weren't outstanding physicians. But our commitment isn't just to get doctors in the house to provide quality healthcare, we want to make sure that the care that we provide is missionally driven. And you'd be amazed at how surprisingly difficult it was to find people who were truly committed to the mission. I'll get into a little bit into that a little while later. 

About a year later, after we identified the location, we were actually able to open our office. We started with about 150 patients. Well, what is it that we provide? $80 a month, and you receive everything on this list. Everything in the parentheses are {22:47 indistinct} here. For example, for laboratory services, we provide all the routine lab services - I don't want to get into a debate as to whether or not routine lab services are even warranted - but, if we do them, we cover them. However, we don't just say, "I'm gonna check your CVC and TSH, but if you want that T4, you gotta pay out of pocket". We actually negotiate with labcore to where we get between 50 and 75 percent off their entire library. Why would they be willing to do that? Because we as an institution will go into a double financial risk for all the labs that we ordered. We pay for everything, and our patients reimburse us for anything that's not included in membership.

Medications. Any drug less than $10 a month, we include as part of our membership. So, what about that 80 year old individual who - if you look at statistics - on average is on 10 medications a day? How can you pay $100 a month out of that membership when this Medicaid individual only pays $860 a year? Well, the answer to that question is actually quite... by the way, our lawyer also said that we're the only healthcare institution they could identify that actually charged you less for people as they got older. Scripturally speaking, I think we have a commitment to the elders. They are the ones who brought us into this world and raised us. We feel morally we have to have a commitment to them as well. Which is why we actually charge less for elders - actually, anybody over the age of 60. So...

As <Speaker 6> described, we don't just stop with what exists within our four walls. We have also basically undertaken upon ourselves the responsibility of pre-negotiating rates, like an insurance organization would, on behalf of patients. We are going out, weekly, talking to different organizations, different subspecialists, allied health providers, service providers as well, to basically get... Our initial negotiations start at Medicare rates. Now, you might say, "Why don't you do Medicaid rates?" Because, we want to have good working relationships with people. That being said, we need this not only to be equitable for our patients, we need this to be equitable for our fellow providers. Medicare is a great starting point. You'll hear me briefly talk about microeconomy at the end, but what we're trying to do here is not just create bargains for our pateints. We're trying to create a micro economy for providers to operate independent of the current system.

Things that are pending... This is actually almost in chronological order. We're currently crowdfunding our diagnostic ultrasound, as we intend to bring on OB into our practice. I think we ordered one that's like $38,000. I'm not sure. We crowdfunded it, and in about 6 weeks we got $24,000. And there's apparently another donor matching what we got, so we actually may be above. Fitness, nutrition. We are about wellness. We are about treating the whole individual. I personally believe obesity and hypoglycemia might be the greatest threat to national security. Therefore, we need to be very deliberate about how we address that. Lifestyle modification. We're bringing on health coaching. Massage therapy we actaully kind of already have in place, but we haven't implemented it yet. Home care services. Keep people in their homes. We are actually networking churches and healthcare providers - nurses, MAs, etc. - who already are wanting to volunteer, and simply lack a mechanism of being able to do so, through an organization that can provide and coordinate care throughout the community. We can't do this as a for profit organization. We can't technically do it as a church. But we can do it as a para-church organization. We're in the process of developing that infastructure right now.

General surgery. We're actually about 2 years ahead of schedule and general surgery. Dr. VanderKooi coached us after he found out about our organization, basically saying, "I don't know how we're gonna do it, [but] we need to figure out how I can work for your organization." Not everybody needs surgery, so putting a surgeon on staff for a few thousand people... probably not going to be able to justify a salary. We've had to innovate a fee schedule, which is why last week I was over at {27:10 indistinct} Hospital. along with our operations officer, basically negotiating preferred rates for surgeries. Talking with advanced radiology for radiographic services. Talking with physical therapy. Talking with anesthesiology. No, I unfortunately cannot bundle payment for everything. But, I can do the legwork, so that when the patient has to interface with the healthcare system, we can provide them with an input that makes it look like a money <uncertain> payment.

Again, we needed to make it equitable for everybody, which is why, currently, we're projecting that we're going to provide on average 60% savings for cost of services. That $50,000 knee replacement that you need... how does $24,000 sound? Now, you might have to pay out of pocket for that, but, we don't have any control over how our patients insure themselves, but I will tell you that <Speaker 8> will be quite happy to know that his organization gets to save itself $26,000 for a knee surgery because their patients are taking advantage of the relationship that we're creating. Microeconomy.

Financial stewardship. How can we possibly make this work with 17 employees? 3 physicians, 2 midlevel physician extenders, a chiropracter, a clinical psychologist, a bunch of nurses... the remaining staff are an executive team, advancement team, front desk. The way we do it is, we recognize that there's gonna be some sacrifice. We intentionally selected individuals who were mission-fit and we basically pegged in our bylaws that income is gonna be stapled to the 50th percentile of the national average.

We are committed to being good stewards of our own employees. Part time or full time, all of our employees are given Samaritan Ministries membership. Them and their families. Basically, we try to take very good care of our employees. We're not going to reimburse them exhorbitantly, but we do want to be good stewards of our employees. How can we afford to do it? 572 patients per physician. The national average for a patient count for primary care, particularly family practice, is 2,300, 2,200, somewhere around there. You need 572 patients for the organization to be solvent. That's pretty awesome. However, the advantage of being a not for profit is we have an advancement team that goes around to various organizations and donors to try and acquire for us charitable contributions for operational expenses. We also have a marketing team, and actually the first thing we did when we - probably about two and a half years before we even opened - is we actually hired on [a] marketing stategy team that helped us with branding. Our primary demographics that we're trying to focus on are small business Christian individuals who want to be good stewards of their employees but can't afford to put a quarter of their net revenues towards what? Paying for healthcare coverage. So, you either provide healthcare for your employee, or you give them a 2-3% raise. It's tough. We're trying to create an easier avenue to provide better stewardship for their employees at a far more affordable rate. Obviously, targeting churches, as well as fiscal conservatives, moral conservatives, political conservatives... we've been advertising in front of Hannity radio in our region. A bunch of Christian radio stations have been giving us free airtime, which has been pretty amazing. The day after Labor Day we had 21 people, 22 people sign up in one day. That's the weekend that we started our radio campaign. We actually had Ken Bhat {30:55 uncertain} perform what's called a viability study. You're probably asking how can we create a fiscally independent organization that's viable. Well, this is how. The viability study that he performed is called a Bhat Analytical Model{31:10 uncertain}. It's basically the model that they use to evaluate solvency for organizations. They look at financial stewardship, corporate structure, assets, so on and so forth. It's the model that they use for banks to determine if something is worth investing in. Well, technically we don't have anything to put up as collateral, so we couldn't take out a loan, but we still took a study and gave it to our donors to show that the we that we have designed our organization is efficient. We have, according to his study - I didn't make this up - a greater than 99% probability of being viable, profitable, solvent, at five years. That's not saying that it's gonna TAKE us five years to get there, that's saying, in five years, we'll still be around. In fact, this $1.8 million project - the 1.8 is really not just first annual cost for startups; it's actually how much money we project it will take to get us profitable, which is about a year and a half. Annual operational costs are gonna be about $1.4 million. We are projected to be profitable by October 2018. We've been open for 3 months. I don't know of many for profit organizations that are profitable in a year and a half.

Right now, we have 500-some patients. We've more than tripled our numbers in less than that many months, which is pretty good. But, obviously, talking to patients isn't quite enough to make payroll. So, we have our advancement team out there - not quite $900,000 - currently, this year, we're trying to raise in charitable givings, our chief Financial Officers currently predict that we're gonna acquire just over a third of that, about 2/5s of that. To date, we only have $27,000 in loans, and all of that $27,000 is from the three gentlemen, including myself, who started the organization. We just needed some start up capital to hire a lawyer to do the research to help us get started.

How are we making it work right now? Half of us aren't getting paid. Which is why it was vitally important to find physicians who are here because of the mission, not because they're hoping that DVC will pad their pockets. There are obstacles, absolutely. Identifying the people who you would choose to start the organization is of vital importance.

Future plans... I already described services that we're pobably going to be adding in the next year to three years. W e are expecting to expand out to other regions. Currently we have fifteen cities across the United States asking us to plant clinics. Currently, Peoria is our next target city, for very good reasons. We are currently doing our due diligence on an $8.7 million facility, through which we can perform all sorts of procedures. We're trying to get our organization started first, but Dr. VanderKooi's kind of pushing us and introducing us to individuals who may make that a reality sooner than we expected by about 2 years. We've even explored the possibility of creating senior living environments. The regulations regarding skilled nursing facilities, and even assisted living facilities, are difficult for us to navigate, but in terms of senior living resident homes, and independent living, we're hoping that we can provide those sorts of living environments for people who would choose to share our values. We want to create an equitable living environment for those people. We have hoped thus far that maybe in 8 to 10 years we could even consider starting our own medical school that would allow Christian medical education to continue existing. Because we all know that Christian medical ethics is under threat.

I'm a macroscopic type of guy. Main area of interest in healthcare is actually ethics and technology in ethics, so broad picture interpretation, what is our plan? Reclaim the healthcare experience for our patients. Unfortunately, the quantification of healthcare, all the analytics that go into it, are overly objectifying what should be a qualifyable experience. We are being turned into {35:40 indistinct} managers rather than true patient care providers. Our goal is to restore the relationship that should exist in healthcare. We're trying to redefine what is quality. Quality isn't defined by patient expectation, quality isn't defined by social pressure. Quality is defined by God, and that which constitutes humanity. We want our patients to define what is their quality, and to be quite honest, let's be fair: what is quality to our patients? What's quality of life? Being able to enjoy relationships with people [whom] they love. So, the care that we provide is tailored to the body and facilitating love. I know that sounds really emotive...

However, what we're trying to eliminate is the moral conflict of interest and financial conflict of interest that's introduced by third party payer systems and the government. Direct primary care. Not for profit has facilitated that evolution, so to speak. We are currently trying to establish a microeconomy where all aspects of healthcare can operate independently of third party payer systems. This is not intended to be a west Michigan phenomenon. This is intended to be a vehicle that we extend to the rest of the nation. We want there to be a microeconomy where people can choose to opt out of the traditional healthcare delivery model - and we call it traditional; it's actually kind of a misnomer, because it's only been since 1964. Barely three generations. Right? Really what we're doing is, we're turning back to the way healthcare was originally delivered. So, we want to restore healthcare to what it was, and make it equitable for everybody to do so. Our true objective... we want spiritual revival in our country. We need cultural revival in our country. We need people - secular [and] religious alike - to recognize that the postmodernists distortion and mutilation of what has for two millenia been fairly concrete in terms of quality, is being defaced. If we, corporately, don't create an environment where we combat the effects of the Fall, well... I would rather that Christ have less work to do when He comes.

*** [4-38:08] Comment 7.1

I was asking <Speaker 6> about the vaccine situation. She told me that 95% of your kids are on vaccines for children, which you cannot have... If you have any insurance that technically would cover vaccines, then the kids don't apply for the BFC program.

*** [4-38:31] Speaker 7

That's true.

*** [4-38:33] Comment 7.1

How do you work the thing as far as - I'm assuming patients may need catastrophic healthcare, they end up having to be hospitalized - yet how do you work it with getting vaccines for them?

*** [4-38:57] Speaker 6

We've been paying attention to what our patient demographics are, who actually comes. So far, most of my patients are health sharing ministry families, so it hasn't been an issue at all.

*** [4-39:12] Comment 7.1

Because they don't pay for vaccines, I imagine.

*** [4-39:14] Speaker 6

Right, so they qualify for BFC. For the other insurance companies, I've just gotten really agitated, like, who can go to our local health department (which actually is really close to us)? What ages can go to Rite Aid, to Walgreens, and CostCo, and what are the prices there? We'll talk about the vaccines at the visit, and then they can go. But, really, that's been a very small percentage. Almost all the vaccines hae been given right in our office.

*** [4-39:44] Speaker 7

For adult vaccines, we organizationally are committed to providing outstanding quality care as defined by our specialties, therefore we are compliant with the immunization schedule for adults, and we include those in membership.

*** [4-40:00] Comment 7.2

Many medications unfortunately [aren]t  in that $10 range. Probably one of the more expensive aspects of medical care for our patients. Do you have relationships with pharmacies? Do you have those cards they send off all the time? <indistinct> those for the patients - <indistinct> insurance that covers medicine, or what?

*** [4-40:19] Speaker 7

G--x {40:20 uncertain}. I wouldn't say we exclusively use {G---x}, but we use {G--x} for all of our uninsured or non Medicare part D individuals. We still can provide tremendous cost savings to our patients through our distributor. We actually use a wholesale distributor, just like any pharmacy would, to obtain our medications, we just don't upmark the cost of medications. Anything over $10 they pay, but we provide them with literature that shows how much savings we afford them. If we can't get it cheaper than another provider in the community, we refer them, or we send the prescription to that facility.

*** [4-40:57] Speaker 6

And we can get a lot of medicines for under $10. We have most of the things you need for common issues at under $10.

** transcript 5.1 DONE
*** [5-00:29] Speaker 8

<Speaker 2> asked me to kind of set up the stage, a little bit, around reimbursements for healthcare.

I'm [employed by] Samaritan Ministries. We are a healthcare sharing ministry. We want to dig down into this issue of, how we've gotten to where we go, but I don't want to talk a long time, because I think we really could use some time to interact with each other. As we sat here today, we've talked about Hippocratic medical society, training, credentialing, practice. All of these things fitting together, they're really one thing for us as we look at the consumer of the healthcare goods, which is the patients. [Those are] the people that I work for. Because Samaritan Ministries members are among many of your patients in the healthcare world. I like to use baseball season - I am a baseball nerd; if you're not a baseball fan or a baseball nerd, I'll apologize if I use an illustration in that way - baseball doesn't work if there's only five people on the field. You'll lose. The ball is almost impossible to stop. We have really good hitters in Major League baseball today, and they'll be able to find the hole in that. Now, six people, you're probably still going to lose. Seven people, you may have a little bit of a chance. But really you need all nine players on the field. There needs to be a pitcher and there needs to be a catcher. There needs to be three people in the outfield. There needs to be someone at first base to catch the ball, so that you can get the guy out. As we look at the healthcare field that you're in - the healthcare sphere, the healthcare panorama - that we're living in right now, we have to look at this the same way that a good baseball manager looks at fielding his team. We have to look at this as if all of this is one thing, because if any of the pieces that we've talked about today - training, credentialing, practice, reimbursement - if any of those are lacking, this doesn't work. We're not going to fix anything.

The big deal here is that we have to think about this a little differently. Christians, for a long time, have been harping around in our country for a seat at the table. We're looking at it backwards. Because it's our table. Jesus Christ owns the table. We sit at it already. To look at this as if we have something to prove, and that we have something to do to interject ourselves - because, I can tell you that if we started a medical school and ran it by Christian principles, it will be the best medical school in the country within 20 years. If we start an accreditation system for physicians, within 20 years it will be the only one that anyone cares about. Because, none of you got into medicine because you wanted to get rich. Christians don't go into medicine because they want to get rich, especially if they've studied economics. Christians get into medicine because they care about people. Christians get into medicine because they read the parable about the Samaritan, and they want to go and do likewise. We don't have to be concerned about how this fits together, but we have to get out there and do something about it. We have to stop sitting around and saying that their system is the one that works, because it doesn't. We have to look at it from a perspective of... our job as Christians in this field is to look people in the eye and figure out what they need and how we can deliver it to them. And certainly, as professionals, you need to be expect to be paid for the service that you provide for people. You need to be able to expect that within a fair market you'll be able to make a living at what you do. I can tell you that if I came to any of your offices, I don't care if you have malpractise insurance. Because I've read 1 Corinthians 6, and if I have a problem with you, there's a way for us to handle that. And it's not in the courts. If I come to your office, I don't really care where you went to medical school. I care if the patient that I talked to before I went in there got the kind of service that they want. If, as there's Christians in the medical industry, we are able to police ourselves, with our own certification, it will be better than anything the world has to offer. Because we care if the patient dies. We care if the person walks out of your office with a smile on their face. We care about that. And because you care about that, you're going to be different.

I don't have time to do all the work that needs to be done, that <Speaker 4> and the others [were] talking about, but I don't have to do it all, and neither do you. That's the big thing that we need to see here. Satan wants you to believe that there's more work to do than can be done. That's the genius of the parable of the Samaritan. Jesus doesn't say at the end of the parable, "Go fix poverty." He saids, "Help the guy in the ditch." See, Satan makes it big. He makes it seem impossible. Somewhere along the way, we in this nation - Christians in this nation - started to believe that the Federal government had unlimited funds, and that Jesus was broke. And when I say it this way, you laugh. You laugh because, we know the Federal government does not have unlimited funds (printing presses notwithstanding), and we know that God does. Why are we acting like it's not true? Because we're believing in lies. <Speaker 2> asked me to set the stage for what healthcare sharing ministries should be looking for for reimbursement if you folks are no longer credentialed by any of the standard licensing agencies. And I can tell you, that from Samaritan Ministries' standpoint, we don't care. If our member trusts you enough to come and see you, then we want you to get paid. Our guidelines aren't going change at all. I know some of the other healthcare sharing ministries use all kind of changes, and there's different ways that they approach it - MediShare uses a network that you have to belong to - we don't have any of that, because we don't like it. Because we think the patient and the doctor are the important people here. Our organization exists to coordinate people bearing one another's burdens. Now, you'll note that our organization therefore does not exist to make decisions about what treatment people should choose. Now, we don't share 100% of the treatments. I know someone mentioned vaccinations; we don't share routine care, and there's a reason for that. It's because patients need to be able to think about what care costs. The reason healthcare is expensive isn't because you guys are overcharging for it. It's because there's no marketplace left. There's no engagement around cost and benefit analysis. Why do we still do colonoscopies? Why has there not been someone who figured out a less uncomfortable way to accomplish that? It's because they get paid $1,500 for them. There's no reason to have another option for it because the patient doesn't care because he's not paying for it. I know some of you are scientists, and I'm not, I'm an economist. And I have both hands... Sorry, if you're not familiar with the Eisenhower joke there, we'll explain that one later. The idea [is] that the patient needs to be engaged in the picture. The patient needs to see how much you charge. He needs to be able to actually argue about it. You shouldn't be signing contracts with insurance companies to figure out how much you're going charge them for things. You should be talking to your patients. That's the brilliance of the Christian healthcare centers; they're thinking about a direct relationship with the patients. That's the brilliance of what APS is doing; they're thinking about how to engage patients around the picture.

You guys spend all of your time and a huge amount - more than half - of your overhead, in general , filing paperwork with the government and with insurance companies. When you want to be talking to patients. To make a living, you've got to spend 5, 6 minutes with the patient, when you know you'd really like to spend 20 or 25. You're accepting money from Medicaid because you don't think that there's any way that you could make it without it. I think it's time to fix that. Samaritan Ministries is one little piece of that. The big deal here is that we have to throw the doors open. We've gotta shine the light on it. Because the marketplace works. Economics is very simple. We live in a country where, when the free market works, it produces wealth. That was the brilliance of the Austrian innovation: to understand that economics is not a zero sum game. When you provide something for me, and I pay you for the services that you've provided, both of us win. There's no winning or losing in a free financial transaction. Both the buyer and the seller win. There is no person taking advantage of someone else. When I give you something, and you give me something back, we both got what we wanted, for less than we were willing to part with. That's the beauty of it. If your patients don't know how much money their insurance company is paying you for what they do, how do you expect them to value it properly? How do you expect them to see what brilliance and beauty you're producing in their lives, as you share Christ's love for them through your service and your vocation and the gifts that you share? What Samaritan Ministries allows, because we ask you to print up a paper bill, [is that] they can see it and send it to us - though we're working on a way to do it electronically, soon - they allow you to be transparent with your patient;fFor them to appreciate you by paying that bill and for you to have that transaction along with them. If we're going to win this, if we're going to see real change in healthcare, it's going to have to be back to that point where the patient cares about you and you care about the patient, and the insurance company can go off and jump in a lake. I know that sounds scary. All of this sounds scary. That's the great part about it. We don't have to be afraid. If I remember correctly, 365 times in the Bible, the words "fear not" appear. 365... that number sounds familiar. That's the number of days in a year! For every single day of the year, God says, once, to you, "Don't be afraid." So when you wake up tomorrow, there's another one. Because He is there. When <Speaker 4> stands up here and says he believes Jesus changes everything, that was the most important thing he said. Jesus changes everything. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are standing there, in front of a furnace that they're about to be tossed into, and what do they say? "God's able to save us from the furnace. And even if he doesn't, we don't care. Because we're not gonna bow down to your idle." When David comes out, and he sees the people cowering in the foxholes, and Goliath taunting God, he doesn't say, "Oh, that guy's pretty big." No, he says, "Who is this heathen Philistine that dares defy the armies of the living God?" See, we are - friends, brothers, sisters - WE are the army of the living God. Five stones and a sling is all we need.

I'm going to wrap up here, because I want us to talk. I want us to engage around - not just the issue of reimbursement, but everything that we've gone through today. What are the next steps that we can see to encourage one another? I'm willing to answer any questions you have about Samaritan Ministries and how we work, but let's not walk away from here today with a spirit of fear. Let's not walk away from here with a spirit of uncertainty. Let's walk away from here today with a spirit of surety, that the God who began a work in each one of us is going to complete that, and that He has a plan that encompasses all of this, and all we need to do is walk in it. And it's going to work. Now, it might work painfully. There's lions and tigers and bears, and colisseums, that exist, and I can't tell you for sure which age we live in. But I can tell you that I don't wanna be the person who doesn't deserve to be thrown into the colisseum because nobody knew that I was in love with Jesus. And I don't think you do, either.

So let's talk.

*** [5-16:11] Comment 8.1

You saw that there were roughly a million Americans in health savings ministries. I have a handful of close friends, including my brother, who have been a part of these. Uniformly, they've found [them] dramatically better than other arrangements they've been part of before. What keeps that number from being five million, ten million? 

*** [5-16:34] Speaker 8

Well, you haven't signed up yet.

<general laughter>

*** [5-16:37] Comment 8.1

I work for [a university], and my co-pay is $250 a month, it covers my entire family with no deductibles.

*** [5-16:48] Speaker 8

One of the things that we know is that employer-provided insurance is going to be here for a little while. One of the - and I will speak positively, occasionally, about healthacare reform - one of the things that the Affordable Care Act could have accomplished, especially if they'd dropped the emloyer mandate, is they could have moved us away from an employer-centered system. That is probably the lynchpin in our healthcare problems, that employer-provided system where if you buy insurance through your employer, that you save literally 30% in taxes off the first 10% of your AGI, because you can't deduct it any other way. You're saving your payroll taxes, you're saving your Federal income tax, whereas if a self-employed person or a person who's buying insurance from his agent down the street, they're going to pay a tax on that until the cost gets above 10% of their income, and they're going to pay payroll taxes on it either way. Which is patently ridiculous, by the way. But it's what we've backed into. I mean it's a really awful tax <indistinct> benefit, and the the only tax increase that I can personally support would be taxing insurance benefits and letting people deal with it, and level the playing field. I don't know how to get around that, but I do know that for a lot of our members, they're choosing not to participate in their employer benefit plans, because they want their dollars to be going to someplace that doesn't do abortions. They want their dollars to go to someplace where they can be in control of it. They don't want to be stuck in a network with the employer-paid plan. They want to be able to engage doctors that they want. They want to be able to choose a direct primary care physician. Those are choice that we have to make. But when your employer provides it, it's very difficult to get around it, and of course, the Affordable Care Act doubled down on that employer problem with the mandate, where people are afraid to drop their program, because $2,000 per person per year is not cheap. It's, for big employers, not awful, it's not quite as bad as the $36,500 per employee per year if you offer a bad plan, which is another... I don't know if anyone ever did the math for you, but that was the really weird thing about the Hobby Lobby case: if you offer no insurance to your employees, the fine was $2,000 per employee per year. If you offer great insurance that doesn't include birth control, the fine was $36,500 per employee per year. They were being punished for offering something that offered 99% of what they were supposed to do.

*** [5-19:31] Comment 8.2

I was very impressed when I visited Samaritan Ministries. Thank you for what you do.

When I hear about groups like yours, and about the Direct Primary Care, and when I listen to APS {19:47 uncertain} things, I come away, often, with the same questions, because the focus often is on primary care outpatient services for a generally, relatively healthy population... where most of my career has been spent in the ICUs of academic medical centers and cancer centers. In one way, I see that there has been a microeconomy formed, and even micro- microeconomies, but they take advantage of the larger economy of healthcare safety nets, the cancer care centers that will not deny patients... so the populations I'm wondering about are - the provision of in-patient, expensive - we spend most of our dollars - we over-utilize hospitals, we over-utilize ICUs, but we still utilize them - these programs, how do they impact in-patient, expensive care? The outlier, hepititis cases, and the patients with chronic illness? I have close friends that have Down Syndrome daughters that both have H-- {21:10 unsure} Disease, and have to go down to the GI specialist every month. If they have that kind of plan, it's very expensive.

*** [5-21:21] Speaker 8

Well, that depends. Chronic care and preventative care are two different things. We want to separate those out.

If you went and got a test just because you turned 45, we don't share that. It's preventative, just a routine... But if they discovered something, because at that point, you have symptoms - we do share your test at that point, which is the opposite of what the Affordable Care Act does, which is, it moves you from preventative care, which is 100% covered, to diagnostic test, which is now subject to your deductible, which means that you thought that you were getting your $1,200 test for free, and now you're paying $1,200 for it, which is always fun if you're a patient, I'm sure. We do have members with chronic care. The big deal with chronic care for Samaritan - and we're working on a plan design that's going to hopefully address this - is people with chronic issues that require most of their maintenance is through medication. So, I have chronic asthma, I use a prescription inhaler called Symbicort. It runs, without our discount plan, about $300 a month. Lately, I've been getting it for $25. We do encourage people to have savings for healthcare. But, $300 is manageable. I mean it's something you can set aside, and decide you're going to eat out less, tighten down your budget. If it's $3,000 that's another whole matter. We know that there's a hole that works along with that. We've been dealing with the hole by making specific exceptions up to this point. For example, someone had a liver transplant about 3 years ago, and we made the decision that even though it was a prescription, the anti-rejection medications that the person was going to have to take, we were going to share those. Because it's silly to spend $300,000 on a liver transplant and then to not let them have the anti-rejection medication that makes the liver transplant continue to work. A few other things that we've made some specific requirements around that, are some of the new cancer drugs that are replacing chemotherapy - we're sharing those like we would if they were a treatment. We're working on something that's more of a comprehensive solution. In our design around our plan currently we have a 120 day limit on prescriptions, which, if you're taking $4 generics, is a non-issue, compared - especially when you're comparing our monthly cost to the monthly cost of what an insurance policy would be - but we know that there are some holes in that, but we're dealing with them temporarily on an exception basis, and we're looking for a redesign on our overall plan to be able to address that.

As far as acute care, things like the ICU, things like that, our members are getting those needs met. We're meeting over $25 million a month in medical bills among our 70,000 families. I personally had an incident where my youngest son was born, and he was born without a heartbeat. His APGAR was zero, for you OBs. And he was revived. He spent eleven days in the NICU. He currently is causing lots of trouble for his older sisters in the way 4 year-olds do, but it was $200,000. For the OB, for the emergency section, for the anesthesiologist, for the 11 days in the NICU - we paid our bills. We paid cash. There's no judgment sitting out there. Now, I got a discount, because I'm not stupid; I know that list price is not what you want to pay for healthcare. But I still paid more than Blue Cross Shield would pay for that. But every single dollar got paid. I got notes and cards from 41 different states. I've got a stack in my office, this tall, of cards from people that I will never meet. And they're praying for us, they're encouraging us, and over 400 different families shared in that need. Yes, there's a little bit of beaurocratic nightmare that goes with that, where I'm taking those checks and stamping them and depositing them, but there's also those individual cards that we sat at the dinner table to open up and read, and so, while we're still figuring out how our life works with a newborn baby, people are praying for us. They're encouraging us. They're personalized notes - they've never met us. And yet, that's a part of what we do - we connect people to one another in a real way, and the same way that you do with your patients. If you see them face to face. And we do that for people with one another when they have large healthcare bills

*** [5-25:58] Comment 8.3

I have a question. If you pay out $50,000 for a surgery [and] get these checks from various people throughout the country, do you have to report it as income, then?

*** [5-26:11] Speaker 8

No. Occasionally, we have had members who have gotten audited. Usually what triggers an audit is when you have someone who makes $60,000 who turns in a Schedule A - is there an accountant in the room? We'll call it a Schedule A - turns in a Schedule A - and deducts the $75,000 surgery. The IRS tends to think that maybe you didn't pay $75,000 for a surgery, [when you made] $60,000, and maybe there's some source of income that you have. And they've gotten audited. Usually we'd compromise around that. If they have to, they just adjust their Schedule A and change the deductions. We tell our members that we don't advise them to deduct those things on their taxes for that reason. We've never had a member get audited otherwise. We look at this as - they're gifts from one person to another. You are allowed to receive a gift of any amount, from anyone, without paying tax on it. The GIVER is taxed on that if the gift exceeds - I think this year it's $18,000 dollars. It's a large number. It's more than I'm gonna give. But we don't have any members that their monthly share gets up that high, so that's not a big deal for us. At this point, if a member did get audited, we would defend them, if it got beyond the administrative level, because we think that's important that the members not be taxed on this.

*** [5-27:38] Comment 8.4

Do you think that it be 51 votes in the Senate for your buildings - changes - makes it tax-deductible <indistinct> pay health savings dues and...

*** [5-27:52] Speaker 8

Right now, I am 51% sure that you can't get 51 votes on the Senate on pretty much anything. Beyond that... What we've actually done is, we've got a bill thats sitting in Congress right now that would allow the use of healthcare sharing ministries with an all savings account. Instead of insurance. Now, we would personally -  I as a free market person and a little libertarian - I prefer if you didn't have to have ANYTHING associated with your health savings account - insurance of any kind - and forget healthcare sharing ministries in the bill, why carve us out? Let's just carve out the taxpayer and say, "Hey, do you want a health savings account? Have a health savings account." But, government, they like to tax you. So, you don't get that. So, we actually have - we continue to lobby on tax reform bills. I think it's possible that it could happen, that we get deductability. But here's the deal: our entire lobbying budget, as an industry, is in the neighborhood of $400,000. Blue Cross Blue Shield spent more than that last WEEK on lobbyists. And that was probably just at the federal level. If we forget about all they're doing at the state level. And insurance companies, now that we are on the radar screen - which we weren't, for a long time, which is part of the reason the miracle of having this exemption in the Affordable Care Act so that our members are not penalized for not having insurance - now that the insurance companies are aware of us, they're not interested in us being unregulated and getting any of the benefits that they get. Tax scheduling of shares is a nice thing, and it's on our list and we've got a few congressmen that are in favor of it... secretary Price, when he was a congressman, had some language sitting on that. But we don't think it's likely to move unless it gets lumped into something else, and probably only if the {29:42 indistinct} lobbyist is sleeping that day. I like the idea, though. And if you have 51 senetors that you can get for it, then, we'll talk later.

*** [5-30:09] Speaker 2

So, as <Speaker 4> said at the last meeting, "Man, you know, we can sit here and talk, but unless we get an action plan from this, [we] didn't do anything!" So, we need to come to an action plan, and what we're going to do from here. So, we won't, you know, develop an action plan probably in this group right this minute, but I think some of the talks have brought out ideas for everybody about what needs to happen as next steps. I think we should keep in email communication about those next steps, and maybe, if we'd like to put general topics, each of the people that moderated, if you want to make suggestions to the group as to what you think are the next steps for the section that you moderated, or beyond, then please do that. If you share it with me I'll put it out on the email group, or if you want copies... we can do it either way. I'm happy to act as a mail-delivery system if that works for you guys more conveniently, if you'd like to do that.

*** [5-31:30] Speaker 1

During the break, we were discussing that perhaps the best next step is, taking lead from <Speaker 5> - I think during his presentation he said, get the leaders of each group present - roughly twelve of us. We have CMA represented, AAPLOG, ACPeds, CMDA, and we sit down with our representatives from Samaritan Ministries, and Thomas More, and actually hash out - not necessarily a separate organization with additional funding and... things we can't... we already are stretched thin on workers and time... But what do each of our organizations have that could contribute toward this goal? It would be the job of our two attorney members to give us some options. A next action step would be to bring leaders together at the next meeting. Be more concrete.

*** [5-32:41] Speaker 2

I'm going to come to that saying, "What can [my organization] contribute? And what does [my organization] need to see in terms of structure? It's more of an exploratory...

*** [5-33:03] Comment 9.1

I think the way it needs to work is, you need to make a list of the things that you need, which I think were summarized in a lot of presentations today. Put that list together, and then, when you get together with a group, you say, who has this? I can offer that. Boom, check. Who has this? Oh, I have something like that, but it's not quite exactly the same thing, but I can help you get that. Check. If you don't have that list, and you just walk into that room - oh, we'd like to do this, and we'd like to do that... well, how do you... you're just not going to get anywhere. My wife goes shopping without a list. But I have the list in my pocket.

*** [5-33:48] Speaker 2

That reminds me. I want to ask the modarators, if they're willing to share their PowerPoint presentations, [to] please send them to me, and I will send them out to several people that've asked if the PowerPoint presentations are available.

*** [5-34:11] Comment 9.2

This isn't an action plan, but if any of you have not read C. L. Grave's book, "The Battle for America's Soul", I highly recommend it, and I would propose that the title of the Hippocratic society is exactly right, based on his book, and he takes through, in a very simplistic way - I could understand it - the history of Hippocratic medicine versus Platonic medicine, which was really good in the state, not <indistinct> individual. He contrasts that throughout the last 2,000 years. Anway. Simplistically done. The title doesn't reflect what it is about, but it's called "The Battle for America's Soul", by Dr. Grave.

*** [5-35:01] Comment 9.3

Some of us were talking, too, and it seems that we've got two issues. One was LLC. Separate from Hippocratic medicine. Although there's a relationship. We talked, as the American College of Pediatricians, this morning, about trying to work some with the NVPAS {35:35 uncertain}. I think that's not an unreasonable thing for us, as both group, to consider.

The bigger issue is practising Hippocratic medicine. Do we set up a brand new organization, or do we find some partnership with which can work? CMDA has this, or David Stevens has his other group, this Medical Ethics Organization. Could it serve as an umbrella organization for groups like the American College of Pediatricians, AAPLOG, and, like what we were describing, ABMS, being the umbrellla organization for these 24 other boards?

*** [5-36:48] Speaker 2

Maybe. I'll have to say, part of what Thomas More society can help us to think through is, what does this look like? This great Lutheran question. What does this mean? There are currently CMDA - there are medical specialty - AAFP - is under CMDA's board. So, to be under them, would be under CMDA's board, and it's structurally - we'd have to think of how that could actually work. If they spun it off, I think, as it currently stands, it would be a problem. Part of what [the] Thomas More society has volunteered to do is to help us look at what are different corporate structures. What's possible? There may be six different corporate structures that we could entertain that would have pros and cons. I don't think we can answer the question, right now, of what structure should we have. I think we have to answer the question of what structure is possible. Which provides which benefits, and what does it mean tax wise, and what does it mean in terms of fiduciary responsibility... Because each of us - different boards have different fiduciary responsibility to our memberships. For example, for us to be a religious organization, which may solve some problems, would actually create some problems for AAPLOG, because then we would lose our ability to stand in court next to ACOG and say, "We, too, are a professional ethics society without a religious affiliation." We have to work through what the structures look like, and I think at the next meeting, we need to come back with, "These are possible structures... These are pros and cons..." And then we could go on to say, "Well, what should we do..." Because I don't think we're at what should we do yet. I think we're still at the information gathering stage in terms of what this looks like.

Alright, I'm gonna wrap up here. This is not the end of the conversation. We should try again next Spring. The goal would be that we would have another meeting, probably here, just because the venue is very inexpensive, and Trinity has been incredibly hospitable to us, and incredibly supportive of what we're trying to do. We had talked about maybe having a meeting here in six months or so. If this works, just think about - and I'll put out dates - of another possible meeting where we can answer those questions, and hopefully we'll meet with Thomas More society before that, and see what the possible corporate structures are, and bring that back here, and just kind of hash out the leadership.

*** [5-39:38] Comment 9.4

I have a quick <indistinct> for both boards to be present.

*** [5-39:44] Speaker 2

I was thinking this whole group could be present - or representatives.

*** [5-39:51] Comment 9.4

Yeah, or representatives. It might be difficult - I'm just thinking it might be difficult for all [the] board members...

*** [5-39:58] Speaker 2

    Okay. And representatives from the boards - we have all the board members here right now, which is really beautiful, because we wanted our boards to understand what we're trying to get involved in. But yeah, maybe just representative - smaller group here, in the springtime.
