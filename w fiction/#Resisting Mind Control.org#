Resisting Mind Control: Theory and Practice

* What This Book Is Not

Controlling a person's thoughts and actions can take many forms: intimidation, flattery, threats, torture, and rhetoric. These all fall under the category of asserting one's will over another, which falls under the category of asserting one's will upon the world, which falls ultimately a superset which contains all possible human action and inaction.

This book is not about all that. It is about something very specific, yet still complex enough that this volume can only be considered a general overview. This guide is focused quite specifically on the subject of those forces which can read semantic information from, or write semantic information to, the human mind, without necessarily having that mind's consent or even awareness. Like any branch of science, there are no distinct lines between this subject and its more general superset or more specific subsets, and so these arbitrary lines have been drawn.

* failsafe measures

The most important part of resisting mind control is having a plan for when your resistance fails. Just like the human body, the human mind - and possibly the human spirit, although that goes beyond the purview of this paper - is finite, and a great enough force, or a great enough profusion of lesser forces, will overcome it. No matter how well-trained a person is or how strong their armor is, there are physical forces that they cannot resist. All matter trembles before the atomic bomb, that is to say, fusion, which dismantles matter at a level far beneath intelligence and design. But the prudent warrior has any number of safeguards, dead-man's switches, and good habits built in, to minimize the overall harm that he suffers when his defenses fail, and to minimize the harm to the things and people he values when his body is destroyed. So the soldier stays good friends with the medic, so if he is shot, someone who has the power to save him is more likely to do so. He cultivates his mind, so that if his body is crippled and he returns to his home without the use of his legs, he is not without prospects, and he can continue to provide for his family, and to engage in activities which give him purpose. And, finally, he sets his affairs in order, so that if he is killed - perhaps by a sniper bullet which he never even saw and did not have the physical capacity to avoid - then his family is taken care of, his debts are paid, and his name is not besmirched. (this ultimate set of safeguards is presumably of no importance to those who believe strongly that there is no afterlife and a certain form of solipsism is the rule - but again, that is beyond the purview of this paper)

* general rules

Sensitive emotions and urges are more easily manipulated (though not necessarily read) than complex beliefs and reasoning. [Like dieting, exercising, or other aspects of maturity] The process of resisting mind control is largely centered on, or at least involves, suspending action based on urges, and instead acting on reason and training. Training: functions like urges (i.e., without thinking, you respond to it), but is much harder to fake or trick using MC.

* Mechanisms of Mind Control

We begin with a brief discussion of two types of mind control which we will not be covering at length in this book.

** Pseudo Mind Control

Semantically, mind control does not affect the sensory organs directly, because "mind control" refers to attacks against the mental processes of a person, independent of external stimuli, and directly affecting the sensory organs is arguably a form of external stimuli. If, for instance, an entity causes a human's ear drums to vibrate, then the result is sound, regardless of whether that sound was transmitted through a familiar medium like air. If an entity uses modulated electrictromagnetic fields to activate the pain receptors in human skin (such as the highly controversial nonlethal compliance tazers, aka "pain wands", briefly manufactured by DARPA, and still in use in some South African territories), that is considered a form of electrocution.

Most things that could be classified as "pseudo mind control" are so beyond the scope of mind control as discussed in this work that they bear no mentioning here, but there is one notable exception: in rare cases, pseudo mind control can be combined with actual mind control (or mind reading) to leverage both methods. The strongest example of this is the Speech-Blocking Chamber used by Dr. Vissenta Patriksson as the antechamber to her private residence in [REDACTED].

Conventional speech-jammers, or DAF (Delayed Auditory Feedback), use a microphone to record a person's words, and headphones to play back that speech to the speaker with a delay of about 175 milliseconds. This confuses the brain's sense of what it should be hearing when the person speaks, and causes the user/victim of the jammer to find it difficult or mentally taxing - but not impossible - to speak.

Dr. Patriksson's device was somewhat more potent, in that it used an unknown agent to record the electrical signals traveling from the brain to the voice box, and then used high-powered, low-yield sonic actuators to directly stimulate the speaker's ears, so that they heard their own speech slightly BEFORE they said it (estimated 100-200 ms delay {research feasibility}). This combination of mind control (reading the brain's electrical stimulus {arguable}) and pseudo mind control (focused stimulation of the auditory sensory organs) was apparently much more effective than traditional speech jammers, and all those who experienced the Patriksson jammer reported that it was only with immense difficulty, and several minutes to orient themselves, that they could consistently speak a single, slow word at a time, and none of them could manage even a short sentence. This effect could be turned on or off for every person in the room; Dr. Patriksson used it, at first, to create a meeting room in which only the dedicated speaker was physically able to speak, but in later years she gave herself the privilege of being the only speaker in the vast majority of meetings she held.

It is estimated that this combination of mind control and pseudo mind control is more effective than a similar method using only mind control would be. Although no extensive research has been done into this exact mechanism, Edgar Jules and Andrew Smith speculate in their book, "The Voice of the World: Nature, Biofeedback, and the Surprising Truth Behind Everything We Do" (although Edgar Jules is rightly considered to be more of a publicist than anything like a real scientist, Andrew Smith had some unique experiences and significant knowledge about mind control and related topics, and his contributions to the book are at least noteworthy, if not compelling), if a person's speech were played back to them, with or without a delay, through an entirely mind-control method, the result would be "curious", "confusing", and "disconcerting", but "not especially problematic." "It would be," they argue, "like speaking through a funnel, or filter, or in a large concert hall with strange reverb, only the reverb would affect the inner voice, rather than the outer." The authors of this book tend to agree, but do note that this is far from a settled matter. Highly speculative.

Further implications and uses of Dr. Patriksson's speech-jamming device are unknown and must necessarily wait upon the recapture of Dr. Patriksson... as she disabled the Chamber during her flight from INTERPOL agents in [year], and although backups of her research were found, they are so thoroughly encrypted that they likely will not ever be decrypted.

** Deep level / fundamental / essential / binary mind control

On the other extreme, there is the possibilitiy of deep level, or fundamental, or "perfect" mind control. This would be mind control whose mechanism is interference with thought at its fundamental level, that is, modification of the electrical conductivity and/or physical arrangement of the neurons themselves. Such mind control has never been conclusively observed. Furthermore, an attack of this type would in principle not be resistable*, and therefore warrants no additional time in this book (*additionally, for an entity to meaningfully control a human being in this way would necessitate their intelligence being so great that they could accurately within it model a human intelligence. Such an entity would likely be so advanced that we could scarecely comprehend it, let alone fight it).

There is, however, a form of deep level mind control - if it may be called that - which is possible, and has in fact been observed. This is a bit of a misnomer, however, for in this case, it's not the brain and all of its thoughts that are controlled, but the external body - principly below the neck, but possibly the neck and face as well. Victims of such mind control find themselves unable to control their own body, but a slave to the whims of whatever is controlling it. This sort of mind control is, of course, extraordinarily dangerous, as there is no direct way to combat it once it has taken hold of you. This type of mind control has only ever been observed via the means of a controlling device (including microchip, battery, and signal transeiver) physically connected with the spine by a not insignificant surgical procedure. It is detectible in others by simply observing the presence of such a device, which will be conspicuous by its presence on the victim's back or neck (such devices require regular callibration and servicing, so are made relatively accessible). One is cautioned that removal or deactivation - including via electromagnetic pulse - of such a device should be done only under controlled circumstances by a trained individual, as permanent paralysis or death can occur as a result of improper removal. For more information, see Publication 4J-9 by the HSC (Homo-Sapien Coalition of Mankind), and for a more thorough investigation of the particular devices associated with the San Juan Crying Man incident, please see "Sans mens rea: A Case Study of Unwilling Criminals", T. M. Worthington, et al., Oxford University Press, [year].

** actual mind control

Unless otherwise mentioned, what is meant by "mind control" in this book is simply this: reading and writing (manipulation) of mental information inbetween its entering at the sense organ and termination in high cognition, or inbetween its exiting high cognition and termination in bodily autonomy/movement. Through example: when you stub your toe, first your toe sends signals containing that information up your spine, then your lower thoughts process the information to mean "pain, I've stepped on something," etc, and then your higher level functions decide how you feel about that. Mind control interacts with the second stage, where you process what the information means. Likewise, consider the case of throwing a ball. First, you make a conscious decision to throw the ball; then, a signal 

* The purposes of mind control

Although there is no limit to the possible motivations behind and effects of mind control, the preponderance of what we know and have seen, and what we know about human tendencies, and what we know about those individuals and organizations and entities which we are confident have a meaningful ability to exhibit mind control, and the interests of space, compel the authors to focus on X primary reasons for mind control that the custodian ought to be aware of and, insofar as it is possible, prepared to react to.

Purposes:

Defensively: As a defense mechanism, to prevent the target from harming the subject
Offensively: As an offense mechanism, to weaken or kill the target so that their resources may be consumed - or, used in tandem with a physical method to kill or otherwise harm (
Super-offensively: To dictate the target's subsequent actions, so that they will benefit the subject, but in a way that is qualitatively more significant than reasons 2 and 3

And, essentially, there are 3 methods:
The application of pain or discomfort (usually associated with defense)
The application of confusion (associated with offense and defense)
The falsification of some amount of input data, such that the target is running on faulty information, but does not feel confused (associated only with super-offensive MC)

* Ques

One must be watchful of ques that one's mind is receiving unwanted external input. In theory, this is almost impossible, because it is intrinsically impossible for the brain to think of its own thoughts at the same level as the thoughts it is using. In practise, it is doable, because all mind control methods are imperfect, and so they may be defeated by imperfect defenses. (note: it is theoretically possible that perfect mind control exists; such mind control would take effect at the lowest level of thought, namely, by directly changing the synaptic firing - the electrical conductivity and so forth - of the constituent cells of the brain, to be that which the MCer desires. Such MC would be in principle not resistible, and therefore no time will be spent on it in this paper.) As the imperfect attacks in this case are the minor tics, spontaneous thoughts, and irreconcilable moments of confusion that inevitably accompany hostile MC, the imperfect defenses in this this case are careful training to cultivate the ability to promptly notice these ques, recognize them for what they are (or are likely to be), and taking pre-defined counter-measures.

* Physiological measures

Pain-type mind control exhibits the same stress response that any other danger does - adrenaline, increased heart rate, sweating, etc. Most of the "symptoms" of mind control are as discussed here, complex, and have to do with what is perceived about the world. However, there are a small number of physiological symptoms which have been positively associated with mind control, even controlling for other factors (such as the stress that often accompanies mind control). There include:
A feeling of tenseness or tightness on the back of one's neck
A feeling that great effort is required to move one's eyes, or a sense that one's gaze is "stuck", or that one is looking in the "wrong" direction
A desire to inflict pain on oneself (although not, usually, injury)
Mild sense of doom {too vague}...
Spontaneously, fully-articulated thoughts along the lines of "I shouldn't be doing this"

* The Tug-of-War {other name? push?}

When actually fighting mind control (as opposed to working around it), it is useful to think of a balance of power existing between oneself and the manipulator, each trying to push the point further towards the other, with the one closest to the point suffering the greatest effects. This is a simplification, but a useful one (for a more detailed analysis and speculation of the physical and metaphysical aspects of mind control, including discussion of {}'s theory that there must exist in real space a hollow sphere with its endpoints connecting the extra-crannial t-focal of both the subject and the target {or other magic stuff}, please see Dietrich Lierdamnn's "Über die Korrespondenz von Ideen und Absichten", "On the Correspondence of Ideas and Intentions"). 

There are ways to "push back" against the control of the manipulator, and significantly reduce (for the duration of the particular attack) their ability to both read and write data to your senses. These methods, however, and not necessarily intuitive. While it is true that a certain "mental fortitude" and general grittiness, willpower, etc. are the most powerful defense, they must be built up before hand over the course of days or years or even whole lifetimes. For the individual who finds themselves in immediate peril, relative to their current supply of willpower, etc., the following strategies have been shown to have a high probability of being helpful.

Against type 1 (pain): 
Against type 2 (confusion): 
Against type 3 (guiding):
If you feel conflicted about what you're doing (note #5, the "I shouldn't be doing this")... forced / suggested actions often develop a natural end-point in the target's brain, as part of the brain's attempt to rationalize itself. "I will do X until Y," it thinks. The brain realizes that it shouldn't be doing X at all, but justifies it by thinking that it is only doing X until Y. These endpoints are neither particularly good nor bad. They are usually a part of the rationalization process, and not implanted from the manipulator (although they can be). However, it will be a good success in the tug-of-war to purposefully end the activity before Y, before the "natural" endpoint that the target's brain perceives. Doing this has several benefits: first, it stops the guided action, and as a rule, guided actions should be avoided. Second, the act of proactively choosing a point to end - especially an arbitrary point, with no special meaning - reinforces to the brain that the original action was not very important, and that one has control over oneself. These have been shown to be positive forces in the tug-of-war battle, and contribute to gaining more overall control of oneself during a mind control event.

* Induced Hallucinations

More complex IHs tend to rely more on the target's own memories/processing?

The most important thing to remember about induced hallucinations is that they are to some extent formulaic, and have weaknesses. It is a common reaction to imagine that there is little or no defense against an entity which can cause induced hallucinations. While the danger certainly is great, it is important to realize that induced hallucinations are imperfect, and to some extent formulaic. However, the formulas are often meta in nature, reflected not so much in the actual imagery seen (although this can be the case with less-complex entities), but in the patterns of how they are chosen and perceived - and not perceived. Given that this is a relatively complex thing to be grappled with in the midst of danger (more complex than "be cautious" or "check if you're really injured), and given that induced hallucinations are usually accompanied by forced emotions and tend to cause heightened emotions, targets are encouraged to learn the following formulas by rote, to think of hallucinations objectively, and to generally "trust the math" rather than their own instincts.

The greatest strength of induced hallucinations is that they will tend to conform in some way to the bias, experience, or outlook of the target. Through careful preparation, this can also be their greatest weakness.

An explanation of this aspect of induced hallucinations: hallucinations are not holograms or projections. Holograms, like videos or still images, have to be composed of a sufficient quantity and precision of data to describe every pixel (or vertice, etc) in the case of flat imagery, or every voxel in the case of holographic imagery. As a rule, induced hallucinations do not contain nearly enough solid information to create a convincing hallucination by transferring to your mind the raw data, so to speak. Not only would this be an enormous amount of information, but it has to be consistent (to avoid having the image shimmer, blur, or flicker), but it also has to account for the target's exact head position, pupillary dilation, ambient light sources, and so on. There is no recorded account of a strong induced hallucination of this type. (The few induced hallucinations of this type which HAVE been recorded tend to ignore scenic-fitness altogether, and tend to appear as flat, evenly lit images directly in the center of the target's vision, which is very alarming and distressing, but not convincing. Targets frequently liken such induced hallucinations to images shown on smartglasses).

The way most induced hallucinations work is similar to how most dreams work (see Mechanisms of Mind Control, a previous chapter): a small amount of information is passed to the target, including usually only a few details, and a general sense of the thing, and the target's brain composes the rest. Normally in human vision, the steps are
The optic nerve relays precise but abstract data to the ABC
The ABC's information is heavily processed, identifying the constituent objects, but removing much of the detail.
It is a "lossy" process, so to speak.
Induced hallucinations skip step 1 and modify step 2, so that the target's brain identifies objects that are not actually there. Since only so much detail can be transmitted from the subject (and processed by the target), the majority of the details - the majority of what the target "sees" - is generated by their own brain. Consider the case of the explorer Simon Birder, and the encounter between his troupe and a type G entity (referred to by most scholars as a Giant Bronze Beetle):

** account: Simon Birder (dangerous animals)

"We had gotten to the point where our walking sticks were in our hands constantly, for although the rocks were not slick, the wind was fierce, and we were all wary of starting a fall down the steep side of the hill that would be not easily arrested. I was in the lead, and I began to feel strongly that we must find shelter soon - though there were many hours of daylight remaining - lest something terrible befall us. Urging everyone else on, I led the way as quickly as I could to a shallow depression in the rock that I thought might serve as a meager shelter. Upon reaching the depression, I saw that it was actually the mouth of a narrow cave, leading into darkness. Despite the ominousness of the cave, it was apparent to me that it would provide excellent shelter, and we had better get inside it immediately. I announced this much to my comrades, and proceeded into the cave. Although I turned on my flashlight, it was still difficult to see, as my eyes were used to the bright, overcast sky outside.

As I crept through the cave, my sense of danger did not abate, but actually increased. I was mindful that wolves, or worse, bears often used such caves for shelter, and would react violently if disturbed, especially with their cubs. I was just thinking that I could almost hear the voice of Dr. Bentley, as he described his dread upon seeing the bear that nearly killed him, and his horror at realizing that he had accidentally approached so close to her cubs. I was unable to look at bear cubs in zoos without feeling trepidation, ever since that, even though the cubs are themselves pleasant and almost harmless. But even their small claws and dog-like faces remind me now only of their deadly elders.

It was as these thoughts filled my head that I turned a corner in the cave which brought my greatest fears to me, and made my heart beat so strongly that it hurt: Two bear cubs sat in a patch of bare rock, staring at me, as still and as innocent as lambs. For a moment I was dumbfounded, terrified, and unable to move. Then I heard one of my companions drawing close to me. He spoke my name, sounding worried, and I heard that it was Armand, and I tried to tell him to run, but he came up beside me and, seeing the cubs, immediately fired at them with his rifle.

I grabbed Armand and yelled at him to leave the cubs alone and run, but I could see his wide-eyes under a brow covered with sweat, and I realized that he couldn't hear me, and in fact I couldn't hear myself. So I took him by the wrist and pulled him with me, as hard as I could, running out of the cave. Luckily it was a simple cave, with no branches that I saw, so we were able to make it out without getting lost. The rest of our crew, save one, had not progressed past the mouth of the cave, and when they saw our terrified faces and heard our babbling, they got enough of the picture to know we had to get away from the cave. Though I could not hear him, I could see Armand's mouth forming the word "bear" again and again.

I do not recall exactly where we went. Gabrielle took the lead, as well as my hand, after seeing that I was not fit to lead myself, let alone my troupe, and she took all of us to higher ground. All the while I found myself looking at every rock and bare bush, terrified and alert that we might stumble upon another cub, and yet bring the mother bear's {term?} wrath upon us. When we reached a small plateau where we could see in all directions, Gabrielle directed those with rifles to make ready, and those without to make as much noise as possible, using the cooking pots especially, and to peer in every direction to see if the bear was chasing us. Gabrielle herself saw to me and Armand, slapping us gently on the face and repeatedly speaking our names, peering into our eyes in turns, until our senses returned to us somewhat. When she tried to speak to me, I was still deaf from the gunshot, and the wind on the plateau was dreadful, so she finally took my notebook and pencil from my breast pocket, and wrote the following question on one of the pages for me and Armand to see: "Omar?"

I looked around, from my companions yelling and banging pots together, to my companions aiming rifles, and saw that Omar was not with us. I yelled at Gabrielle that I did not know where he was, and that I had not seen him.

I do not know how long we waited there, tense with worry - but I suspect it was only a few minutes, as some of them were still banging pots together, and others were debating (I assume) what to do next, when someone spotted Omar struggling up the side of our hill. He had unwisely or unluckily come at the hill from its steepest angle, and could hardly make any progress without exhausting himself, but Gabrielle took two of the troupe and collected him with all the speed that she could. He appeared to be as dirty and shaken as myself and Armand, although not actually hurt, and not quite as deaf.

Omar told us later that he had entered the cave from another way, having become separated from our group, and worrying about his safety. He was in the cave when Armand fired his rifle, and although he was not close enough to be completely deafened as Armand and I were, the shot disoriented and panicked him, and he began running through the cave away (insofar as he could tell) from the sound, without regard to marking his way. It was then that he had a very strange experience. According to Omar, he turned a corner into a wide empty area in the cave, and saw an enormous dog with a black mouth, baring its teeth and foaming visibly at the mouth. Omar turned to run. Hearing the dog growling behind him, and seeing one of our walking sticks on the floor of the cave, Omar ran towards it, and on, through the cave, until he found his way out. He heard the growling of the dog and the rapid tapping of its claws on the stone until he made it out of the cave.

By his descriptions, he exited the cave through the entrance that I had found; but, not knowing where we had gone, he spent several minutes wandering, frequently looking back to see if the dog had followed him. Eventually, he heard the yelling and banging pots, and made his way towards us, which was when he was spotted, and Gabrielle retrieved him.

When we made camp that night - far away from the rocky pass - we talked over everything that had happened. We were all obliged to speak loudly, for Armand's and my sakes - our hearing improved somewhat over the course of the evening, but I fear we have both suffered permanent damage. We are all confused by what Omar saw. It seems certain that he entered the same cave that we did - it was my walking stick that he saw, although I do not remember when I lost it. But how could there have been a rabid dog in the cave? Armand told Omar that he must have seen the bear, but been confused by the darkness of the cave, and the gunshot. Omar insists that he definitely saw a dog, and described it many ttimes: tan, short hair, short black snout, very dirty, with foam dripping from its mouth. He said it was enormous. He said it must have been one of the guardian dogs the local shepherds use to guard their sheep.

Although Omar has not deviated from his story, and the rest of us are loathe to call into question his faculties, we must admit to being greatly skeptical of his recall. It seems unlikely that such a dog, being as far-taken by rabies as Omar described, would have the faculty to hide so effectively in a cave; or, if it it were not sick, it's unlikely it would have left its home at all. More importantly, we agree that it is incredible that a mother bear would suffer a dog of any kind to inhabit the same cave where she had vouchsafed her cubs. Armand pointed out to us, also, after Omar was asleep, that he knew that Omar had been attacked by a rabid dog when he was a child. Gabrielle confirmed that this was something he had mentioned. Armand summarized our opinion when he said:

"It seems that Omar was so affected by terror at the sight of the mother bear that he lost his senses, and in his flight from her, his mind filled with the same terror he had felt so many years ago when he was attacked by a dog, and the two became one in his memory. But I cannot for a moment look down upon him for this, for while I saw the bear clearly, the sight of it so shocked me that I, took, took leave of my senses, even firing my rifle in the enclosed space, with no regard for the damage I might do to myself or to Simon, and no regard to the fact that my one bullet, without time to aim, was more likely to infuriate the bear than stop her."

We saw no other bears, or dogs, for the remainder of our journey."

** remainder of section

Notes... Clearly, it was one creature, or lack-of-creature. Where Simon saw the bear cubs, Armand saw the mother bear; but Omar, being separated from the others, and having different connotations in his mind to the concept of a "dangerous animal", saw instead something from his own experience: a large, rabid dog, probably a Kangal, just as the one that nearly killed him in his youth.

Clearly, the broad category here is "dangerous animal" (presumably summoned in order to frighten the targets, as a defense mechanism), but the hallucination is not specific about exactly what animal. Each target then perceives whatever dangerous animal makes the most sense to them (or has the strongest emotional power over them) at the time.

Although IHs are usually surprising, they also tend to have an air of being not surprising at all. For instance, in the dangerous animal example, the targets may be surprised that there's a dangerous animal in the first place, but they will NOT be surprised at which dangerous animal it is, nor what it looks like or its other sundry details. This is because, especially for such a weak IH, the vast majority of the details have been filled in by what that target most readily thinks of as associated with the concept (in this case, "dangerous animal).

* The Demon and the Wretch

What follows is a brief overview of some self-help techniques designed to deal with procrastination, motivation, and self-actualization. Their relevance will be made clear shortly. The reader is encouraged to seek elsewhere if this is his primary desire, as procrastination et cetera is only a sidenote in this book, which is primarily about malicious mind control.

The archetype/characterization of the Demon and the Wretch comes from [IMAGINARY PHILOSOPHER]. In simplest terms, this "entity" is the part of you - whether the Id, the Addiction Voice, the Old Adam, etc - which wants you to fail, which works against you, which prevents you from doing what you want to do.

There are two [three?] main characterizations of this.

First is the Demon, also called the Id, the Addiction Voice, the Old Adam, and others. This is imagined as an entity of purest, irrational selfishness, wanting to fulfill only its own basest desires at the cost of all else. This is also the voice of Temptation. Its only desires are to take and consume. It is the root of gluttony, rape, and every other evil.

Second is the Wretch, also called Pity. The Wretch has no desire per se, but it is a being of purest patheticness and wretchedness. It has no loveliness or positive qualities about it, but it knows this. Insofar as it has any desire, it desires to be left alone, to feel less pain, to be numb.

Both of these Daemons, or entities, or characterizations, serve a similar purpose, for those who struggle with motivation and self-actualization. They are a distancing technique. By pseudo-externalizing and visualizing their negative qualities, some people are better able to act apart from them.

The difference is the exact approach that is taken in defeating the entity. Against the Demon, a certain vindictiveness, a pleasure in defeating a wily foe, is called for. Visualiztions include literally beating the Demon or destroying it with weapons, gloating over its defeated body. Against the Wretch, the opposite is visualization is employed. One imagines helping the Wretch up, putting a coat on it, bathing it, giving it food.

This publication does not take a hard stance on whether these distancing techniques are effective or optimal, or which is better (although it will mention, in passing, on complaint that certain psychologists have - that of the potential drawback of purposefully fostering the idea of something so negative being a part of onesself).

The relevance to Malicious Mind Control is.. [I don't know]

* Benevolent Mind Control
* Lotus Eaters / Perpetual Euphoric Dreams
* Mind Control and Artificial Cognitive Enhancement

Of course, arguably any external processing device, right down to tally marks or an abacus, or string tied around a finger to remind oneself of something, constitute ACE. The ubiquity of these devices, and their externalization, however, and their relatively high delay, make them not really worth fussing about. What we're concerned with is present attempts by MIT, DARPA, and [IMAGINARY FIRM] to enhance human mathematical abilities, recall, etc etc, through the use of various physical apparatus, especially electrical stimulation...

* old brainstorming, probably duplicate

The most important part of resisting mind control is having a plan for when your resistance fails. Just like the human body, the human mind - and possibly the human spirit, although that goes beyond the purview of this paper - is finite, and a great enough force, or a great enough profusion of lesser forces, will overcome it. No matter how well-trained a person is or how strong their armor is, there are physical forces that they cannot resist. All matter trembles before the atomic bomb, that is to say, fusion, which dismantles matter at a level far beneath intelligence and design. But the prudent warrior has any number of safeguards, dead-man’s switches, and good habits built in, to minimize the overall harm that he suffers when his defenses fail, and to minimize the harm to the things and people he values when his body is destroyed. So the soldier stays good friends with the medic, so if he is shot, someone who has the power to save him is more likely to do so. He cultivates his mind, so that if his body is crippled and he returns to his home without the use of his legs, he is not without prospects, and he can continue to provide for his family, and to engage in activities which give him purpose. And, finally, he sets his affairs in order, so that if he is killed - perhaps by a sniper bullet which he never even saw and did not have the physical capacity to avoid - then his family is taken care of, his debts are paid, and his name is not besmirched. (this ultimate set of safeguards is presumably of no importance to those who believe strongly that there is no afterlife and a certain form of solipsism is the rule - but again, that is beyond the purview of this paper)

The purposes of mind control:

Although there is no limit to the possible motivations behind and effects of mind control, the preponderance of what we know and have seen, and what we know about human tendencies, and what we know about those individuals and organizations and entities which we are confident have a meaningful ability to exhibit mind control, and the interests of space, compel the authors to focus on X primary reasons for mind control that the custodian ought to be aware of and, insofar as it is possible, prepared to react to.

Defensively: As a defense mechanism, to prevent the target from harming the subject
Offensively: As an offense mechanism, to weaken or kill the target so that their resources may be consumed - or, used in tandem with a physical method to kill or otherwise harm (
Super-offensively: To dictate the target’s subsequent actions, so that they will benefit the subject, but in a way that is qualitatively more significant than reasons 2 and 3

Ques
One must be watchful of ques that one’s mind is receiving unwanted external input. In theory, this is almost impossible, because it is intrinsically impossible for the brain to think of its own thoughts at the same level as the thoughts it is using. In practise, it is doable, because all mind control methods are imperfect, and so they may be defeated by imperfect defenses. (note: it is theoretically possible that perfect mind control exists; such mind control would take effect at the lowest level of thought, namely, by directly changing the synaptic firing - the electrical conductivity and so forth - of the constituent cells of the brain, to be that which the MCer desires. Such MC would be in principle not resistible, and therefore no time will be spent on it in this paper.) As the imperfect attacks in this case are the minor tics, spontaneous thoughts, and irreconcilable moments of confusion that inevitably accompany hostile MC, the imperfect defenses in this this case are careful training to cultivate the ability to promptly notice these ques, recognize them for what they are (or are likely to be), and taking pre-defined counter-measures.

Physiological measures

Pain-type mind control exhibits the same stress response that any other danger does - adrenaline, increased heart rate, sweating, etc. Most of the “symptoms” of mind control are as discussed here, complex, and have to do with what is perceived about the world. However, there are a small number of physiological symptoms which have been positively associated with mind control, even controlling for other factors (such as the stress that often accompanies mind control). There include:
A feeling of tenseness or tightness on the back of one’s neck
A feeling that great effort is required to move one’s eyes, or a sense that one’s gaze is “stuck”, or that one is looking in the “wrong” direction
A desire to inflict pain on oneself (although not, usually, injury)
Mild sense of doom {too vague}...
Spontaneously, fully-articulated thoughts along the lines of “I shouldn’t be doing this”

The Tug-of-War {other name? push?} 

When actually fighting mind control (as opposed to working around it), it is useful to think of a balance of power existing between oneself and the manipulator, each trying to push the point further towards the other, with the one closest to the point suffering the greatest effects. This is a simplification, but a useful one (for a more detailed analysis and speculation of the physical and metaphysical aspects of mind control, including discussion of {}’s theory that there must exist in real space a hollow sphere with its endpoints connecting the extra-crannial t-focal of both the subject and the target {or other magic stuff}, please see Dietrich Lierdamnn’s “Über die Korrespondenz von Ideen und Absichten”, “On the Correspondence of Ideas and Intentions”). 

There are ways to “push back” against the control of the manipulator, and significantly reduce (for the duration of the particular attack) their ability to both read and write data to your senses. These methods, however, and not necessarily intuitive. While it is true that a certain “mental fortitude” and general grittiness, willpower, etc. are the most powerful defense, they must be built up before hand over the course of days or years or even whole lifetimes. For the individual who finds themselves in immediate peril, relative to their current supply of willpower, etc., the following strategies have been shown to have a high probability of being helpful.

Against type 1 (pain): 
Against type 2 (confusion): 
Against type 3 (guiding):
If you feel conflicted about what you’re doing (note #5, the “I shouldn’t be doing this”)... forced / suggested actions often develop a natural end-point in the target’s brain, as part of the brain’s attempt to rationalize itself. “I will do X until Y,” it thinks. The brain realizes that it shouldn’t be doing X at all, but justifies it by thinking that it is only doing X until Y. These endpoints are neither particularly good nor bad. They are usually a part of the rationalization process, and not implanted from the manipulator (although they can be). However, it will be a good success in the tug-of-war to purposefully end the activity before Y, before the “natural” endpoint that the target’s brain perceives. Doing this has several benefits: first, it stops the guided action, and as a rule, guided actions should be avoided. Second, the act of proactively choosing a point to end - especially an arbitrary point, with no special meaning - reinforces to the brain that the original action was not very important, and that one has control over oneself. These have been shown to be positive forces in the tug-of-war battle, and contribute to gaining more overall control of oneself during a mind control event.

Induced Hallucinations

The most important thing to remember about induced hallucinations is that they are to some extent formulaic, and have weaknesses. It is a common reaction to imagine that there is little or no defense against an entity which can cause induced hallucinations. While the danger certainly is great, it is important to realize that induced hallucinations are imperfect, and to some extent formulaic. However, the formulas are often meta in nature, reflected not so much in the actual imagery seen (although this can be the case with less-complex entities), but in the patterns of how they are chosen and perceived - and not perceived. Given that this is a relatively complex thing to be grappled with in the midst of danger (more complex than “be cautious” or “check if you’re really injured), and given that induced hallucinations are usually accompanied by forced emotions and tend to cause heightened emotions, targets are encouraged to learn the following formulas by rote, to think of hallucinations objectively, and to generally “trust the math” rather than their own instincts.

The greatest strength of induced hallucinations is that they will tend to conform in some way to the bias, experience, or outlook of the target. Through careful preparation, this can also be their greatest weakness.

An explanation of this aspect of induced hallucinations: hallucinations are not holograms or projections. Holograms, like videos or still images, have to be composed of a sufficient quantity and precision of data to describe every pixel (or vertice, etc) in the case of flat imagery, or every voxel in the case of holographic imagery. As a rule, induced hallucinations do not contain nearly enough solid information to create a convincing hallucination by transferring to your mind the raw data, so to speak. Not only would this be an enormous amount of information, but it has to be consistent (to avoid having the image shimmer, blur, or flicker), but it also has to account for the target’s exact head position, pupillary dilation, ambient light sources, and so on. There is no recorded account of a strong induced hallucination of this type. (The few induced hallucinations of this type which HAVE been recorded tend to ignore scenic-fitness altogether, and tend to appear as flat, evenly lit images directly in the center of the target’s vision, which is very alarming and distressing, but not convincing. Targets frequently liken such induced hallucinations to images shown on smartglasses).

The way most induced hallucinations work is similar to how most dreams work: a small amount of information is passed to the target, including usually only a few details, and a general sense of the thing, and the target’s brain composes the rest. Normally in human vision, the steps are
The optic nerve relays precise but abstract data to the ABC
The ABC’s information is heavily processed, identifying the constituent objects, but removing much of the detail.
It is a “lossy” process, so to speak.
Induced hallucinations skip step 1 and modify step 2, so that the target’s brain identifies objects that are not actually there. Since only so much detail can be transmitted from the subject (and processed by the target), the majority of the details - the majority of what the target “sees” - is generated by their own brain. Consider the case of the explorer Simon Birder, and the encounter between his troupe and a type G entity (referred to by most scholars as a Giant Bronze Beetle):

“We had gotten to the point where our walking sticks were in our hands constantly, for although the rocks were not slick, the wind was fierce, and we were all wary of starting a fall down the steep side of the hill that would be not easily arrested. I was in the lead, and I began to feel strongly that we must find shelter soon - though there were many hours of daylight remaining - lest something terrible befall us. Urging everyone else on, I led the way as quickly as I could to a shallow depression in the rock that I thought might serve as a meager shelter. Upon reaching the depression, I saw that it was actually the mouth of a narrow cave, leading into darkness. Despite the ominousness of the cave, it was apparent to me that it would provide excellent shelter, and we had better get inside it immediately. I announced this much to my comrades, and proceeded into the cave. Although I turned on my flashlight, it was still difficult to see, as my eyes were used to the bright, overcast sky outside.

As I crept through the cave, my sense of danger did not abate, but actually increased. I was mindful that wolves, or worse, bears often used such caves for shelter, and would react violently if disturbed, especially with their cubs. I was just thinking that I could almost hear the voice of Dr. Bentley, as he described his dread upon seeing the bear that nearly killed him, and his horror at realizing that he had accidentally approached so close to her cubs. I was unable to look at bear cubs in zoos without feeling trepidation, ever since that, even though the cubs are themselves pleasant and almost harmless. But even their small claws and dog-like faces remind me now only of their deadly elders.

It was as these thoughts filled my head that I turned a corner in the cave which brought my greatest fears to me, and made my heart beat so strongly that it hurt: Two bear cubs sat in a patch of bare rock, staring at me, as still and as innocent as lambs. For a moment I was dumbfounded, terrified, and unable to move. Then I heard one of my companions drawing close to me. He spoke my name, sounding worried, and I heard that it was Armand, and I tried to tell him to run, but he came up beside me and, seeing the cubs, immediately fired at them with his rifle.

I grabbed Armand and yelled at him to leave the cubs alone and run, but I could see his wide-eyes under a brow covered with sweat, and I realized that he couldn’t hear me, and in fact I couldn’t hear myself. So I took him by the wrist and pulled him with me, as hard as I could, running out of the cave. Luckily it was a simple cave, with no branches that I saw, so we were able to make it out without getting lost. The rest of our crew, save one, had not progressed past the mouth of the cave, and when they saw our terrified faces and heard our babbling, they got enough of the picture to know we had to get away from the cave. Though I could not hear him, I could see Armand’s mouth forming the word “bear” again and again.

I do not recall exactly where we went. Gabrielle took the lead, as well as my hand, after seeing that I was not fit to lead myself, let alone my troupe, and she took all of us to higher ground. All the while I found myself looking at every rock and bare bush, terrified and alert that we might stumble upon another cub, and yet bring the mother bear’s {term?} wrath upon us. When we reached a small plateau where we could see in all directions, Gabrielle directed those with rifles to make ready, and those without to make as much noise as possible, using the cooking pots especially, and to peer in every direction to see if the bear was chasing us. Gabrielle herself saw to me and Armand, slapping us gently on the face and repeatedly speaking our names, peering into our eyes in turns, until our senses returned to us somewhat. When she tried to speak to me, I was still deaf from the gunshot, and the wind on the plateau was dreadful, so she finally took my notebook and pencil from my breast pocket, and wrote the following question on one of the pages for me and Armand to see: “Omar?”

I looked around, from my companions yelling and banging pots together, to my companions aiming rifles, and saw that Omar was not with us. I yelled at Gabrielle that I did not know where he was, and that I had not seen him.

I do not know how long we waited there, tense with worry - but I suspect it was only a few minutes, as some of them were still banging pots together, and others were debating (I assume) what to do next, when someone spotted Omar struggling up the side of our hill. He had unwisely or unluckily come at the hill from its steepest angle, and could hardly make any progress without exhausting himself, but Gabrielle took two of the troupe and collected him with all the speed that she could. He appeared to be as dirty and shaken as myself and Armand, although not actually hurt, and not quite as deaf.

Omar told us later that he had entered the cave from another way, having become separated from our group, and worrying about his safety. He was in the cave when Armand fired his rifle, and although he was not close enough to be completely deafened as Armand and I were, the shot disoriented and panicked him, and he began running through the cave away (insofar as he could tell) from the sound, without regard to marking his way. It was then that he had a very strange experience. According to Omar, he turned a corner into a wide empty area in the cave, and saw an enormous dog with a black mouth, baring its teeth and foaming visibly at the mouth. Omar turned to run. Hearing the dog growling behind him, and seeing one of our walking sticks on the floor of the cave, Omar ran towards it, and on, through the cave, until he found his way out. He heard the growling of the dog and the rapid tapping of its claws on the stone until he made it out of the cave.

By his descriptions, he exited the cave through the entrance that I had found; but, not knowing where we had gone, he spent several minutes wandering, frequently looking back to see if the dog had followed him. Eventually, he heard the yelling and banging pots, and made his way towards us, which was when he was spotted, and Gabrielle retrieved him.

When we made camp that night - far away from the rocky pass - we talked over everything that had happened. We were all obliged to speak loudly, for Armand’s and my sakes - our hearing improved somewhat over the course of the evening, but I fear we have both suffered permanent damage. We are all confused by what Omar saw. It seems certain that he entered the same cave that we did - it was my walking stick that he saw, although I do not remember when I lost it. But how could there have been a rabid dog in the cave? Armand told Omar that he must have seen the bear, but been confused by the darkness of the cave, and the gunshot. Omar insists that he definitely saw a dog, and described it many ttimes: tan, short hair, short black snout, very dirty, with foam dripping from its mouth. He said it was enormous. He said it must have been one of the guardian dogs the local shepherds use to guard their sheep.

Although Omar has not deviated from his story, and the rest of us are loathe to call into question his faculties, we must admit to being greatly skeptical of his recall. It seems unlikely that such a dog, being as far-taken by rabies as Omar described, would have the faculty to hide so effectively in a cave; or, if it it were not sick, it’s unlikely it would have left its home at all. More importantly, we agree that it is incredible that a mother bear would suffer a dog of any kind to inhabit the same cave where she had vouchsafed her cubs. Armand pointed out to us, also, after Omar was asleep, that he knew that Omar had been attacked by a rabid dog when he was a child. Gabrielle confirmed that this was something he had mentioned. Armand summarized our opinion when he said:

“It seems that Omar was so affected by terror at the sight of the mother bear that he lost his senses, and in his flight from her, his mind filled with the same terror he had felt so many years ago when he was attacked by a dog, and the two became one in his memory. But I cannot for a moment look down upon him for this, for while I saw the bear clearly, the sight of it so shocked me that I, took, took leave of my senses, even firing my rifle in the enclosed space, with no regard for the damage I might do to myself or to Simon, and no regard to the fact that my one bullet, without time to aim, was more likely to infuriate the bear than stop her.”

We saw no other bears, or dogs, for the remainder of our journey.”

Notes…. Clearly, it was one creature, or lack-of-creature. Where Simon saw the bear cubs, Armand saw the mother bear; but Omar, being separated from the others, and having different connotations in his mind to the concept of a “dangerous animal”, saw instead something from his own experience: a large, rabid dog, probably a Kangal, just as the one that nearly killed him in his youth.

Clearly, the broad category here is “dangerous animal” (presumably summoned in order to frighten the targets, as a defense mechanism), but the hallucination is not specific about exactly what animal. Each target then perceives whatever dangerous animal makes the most sense to them (or has the strongest emotional power over them) at the time.

Although IHs are usually surprising, they also tend to have an air of being not surprising at all. For instance, in the dangerous animal example, the targets may be surprised that there’s a dangerous animal in the first place, but they will NOT be surprised at which dangerous animal it is, nor what it looks like or its other sundry details. This is because, especially for such a weak IH, the vast majority of the details have been filled in by what that target most readily thinks of as associated with the concept (in this case, “dangerous animal).

* IMPORTANT NOTES

"If two or more people (that you trust) are telling you something, it's probably true"

* misc notes

** Mind control
Erodes your natural reactions against . Have to rely on artificial learned algorithms. Not instinct etc. A strong feeling of things not mattering. Whenever possible, use precise algorithms and procedures.

** Illusions (old)
The potency of an illusion is said to increase when any of the following increase:

+ How much perceptual data has to be faked / replaced / removed
+ How consistent the illusion is
+ How consistent the illusion is between victims
+ How difficult (emotionally or technically) the illusion is to dispel. The fundamental way to overcome an illusion is to doubt it; often the most efficient way to do this is to find a logical flaw in it. It helps to just go into things in a skeptical state of mind, though.

Overcoming an illusion doesn't make it go away (except in the case of very weak illusions, or very strong skepticism), but it more or less makes it seem unreal; like a phantom image, or a strongly wandering throught, or an optical illusion. It is possible, though tricky, to trick someone into thinking that a real thing is merely a particularly strong illusion.

Illusion X, when expecting real X, is very convincing; illusion X, when expecting expecting not-X, is very unconvincing; X, when expecting nothing in particular, is somewhere inetween.

Stated in terms as relating to an SCP-like team:

+ Subtle/convincing illusions affect few (due to how delicate they are)
+ Gross/unconvincing (but distracting) illusions affect many
+ Team must constantly compare notes, double check things. Especially on small (including physically small) but important details. If one person sees things differently, like a sign or lever or bug or whatever, that person must be assumed to be incorrect. The encourages trust in the consensus, and to some extent discourages out-of-the-box thinking and intuition.
+ During heavy attacks, the dynamic is flipped; most of the team will succumb to distraction, if not actual belief; the one sane person must then be their guide. This can lead to arguments about what counts as a "subtle" illusion and what counts as a "strong" one. Susceptibility to illusions does follow rules, but some of the rules are very complicated and unintuitive (along with a few obvious ones).
