Step 1: check for
YES BUT
NO AND

Step 2: put in spreadsheet, give everything 2+ causes (or 1 causer and 1 causee)



Magic cannot solve problems unless...
...it seems inevitable AND/OR
...it creates even more problems.

Scenes should end with Sidren worse off than before. Usually, at least.

There should be a driving momentum, inevitability, behind things, each new situation arising just moments before the last one has resolved.

For my chart for the story, the spreadsheet, whatever, I want to keep in mind that... I need to figure out in reverse the following things:
3. What Sidren et al are doing,
2. What belief re: magic, the fort, characters' motivations, etc., caused them to do that, and 
1. What caused them to have that belief(s).
This should ideally apply to everything, but should especially apply to knowledge about the fort, Ivearnoun, and magic in general.

* timeline
** Ivearnoun's theft

Ivearnoun was one of the youngest (THE youngest?) members of the Entrusted, who are the guardians of various important artifacts, people, and spells, including the Profound Acts.

Ivearnoun and her lover, Kismor, as well as some of their compatriots, stole the Profound Acts, or some of them. Then they split up and fled, pursued by the other Entrusted and the regular guards. Ivearnoun and Kismor fled together with the two most powerful and most well-known Acts, the Healing Act and the Killing Act. As they ran, one of the Entrusted, Utheostairn, gravely injured Kismor. As Ivearnoun knelt over him, the guards closed in. With a farewell kiss, Ivearnoun cast the Healing Act on her lover, then fled, off a cliff or something, apparently to her death, taking the Killing Act with her. However, neither she nor the Act was ever found. Kismor was captured by Utheostairn and never released. At some point, Ivearnoun was located, but she scared off her persuers by threatening them with the Killing Act.

At least, that’s the story as it is known. What actually happened was this: with the guards closing in, and with Utheostairn at that very moment seizing Kismor, Ivearnoun knew that there was no way for them to escape: even if she healed Kismor and killed Utheostairn, the guards would capture them both. So she tried to use the Killing Act on both of them, to save them from the tortures of the guardians. But though the Act took both of them, the caster within killed only Kismor, refusing to raise a hand against a woman. As the Act finished and the guards reeled from what had happened, Ivearnoun fled and, improbably, escaped. This was aided by the fact that the guardians, seeing that she used the Killing Act, did not want to provoke her into discharging the Healing Act, which was considered the most valuable. Wanting to keep the continued existence of the Healing Act a secret, the guardians spread the word that it was the Killing Act which Ivearnoun still possessed. (The also assumed, correctly, that people would be much less tempted to accost Ivearnoun if they thought it was the Killing Act that she possessed). It is true that, at later times, Ivearnoun used this misconception to escape pursuers, threatening them with what they believed to be the Killing Act, but which was in fact the Healing Act.

Alternatively, when the Killing Act discharged, it killed not only Kismor, but also Utheostairn and all the guards, leaving only Ivearnoun standing.

This happened about 40 years ago. Ivearnoun was 16. Guipathorme was ~50. Brixt’s mother, Veladitou, was 18.

** Ydgar's parade

The first time I met you, they were parading you around the city. Every gate had been opened up, every flower was blooming, there was music in air even when no one was singing, and the news was being past around, whispered and shouted, that the Blue Boy had killed an evil statue.

The King decreed a day of celebration. I don’t think she needed to; everyone was out and yelling and cheering you... I could see nothing through the crowds, although I could hear singing and poetry, and the bird-keepers had released birds of bright orange and yellow and gren, and Guipathorme, the magician, did something... but I was short, and I could see nothing through the crowds, so I waited until my mother was busy with my brothers and sisters, and I slipped away to the front of the crowd to watch you as you passed.

The town crier came first, striking wooden blocks together and shouting, “Behold! Behold!”
Then came Oxivl, who had brought out his troupe of trained dogs.
Then some merchants, who were trying to sell their wares to everyone.
Small children who had escaped their parents’ clutching hands.
Carabao.

And there you were. Ydgar, the Blue Boy. Smiling and waving and laughing, and playing your panpipes, and juggling colored balls. Your bright blue tunic looked like a picture. I saw young people staring at you in wonder, and older folks grasping your hand and saying things to you that I couldn’t hear. I remember finding a red flower in my hand. I don’t know where it came from, but when you passed by me, I held it out to you. Smiling, you took it out of my hand, and replaced it with something else. I looked down and saw that it was a wooden bangle in the shape of a teardrop. While I looked at it, you kissed me once on the forehead. I felt flushed, almost as though I might faint, but you had already moved on. I took the bangle by the point and held it up and looked at you through it, watched you walk away, so tall and joyful and bold. Then I saw Brixt (you remember her, don’t you?) watching me from where she stood holding her father’s hand, and I thought somehow that she was jealous, even though she was four years [???] older than me. I hid the bangle in the folds of my skirt, and I stood where I was and watched you walk down the path until the crowd hid you from sight. Then I turned around and walked back through crowd, away from the parade, past the tanner’s house, over the warm brook, under the bridge, and to the big shadow shaped like a goat. With nobody watching, I took out the bangle and carefully put it on my wrist.

My little brother loves to tell stories, and he remembers so many of them. The next time they were all asleep, my siblings, I woke him up and made him tell me every story he knew of your grandfather. Especially the one about the bear. When my brother went back to sleep, I went out and sat in the sun and imagined you and your grandfather going on adventures together, helping people together. I know that you didn’t. I know you were young when he died. But there was talk—I heard people saying you had his spirit, or it was something in the tunic. I had this strange picture in my head, this idea that you and he were the same, that the Traveller become the Boy because he never died, he kept on travelling, he travelled all of Sond and had aventures and cured sick people and... and swung off his carabao, as he rode through the city, and slipped a wooden bangle, gently, over my wrist.

I remember the way you looked that day. I remember the parade, the crier, the flowers, the songs, the dancing. I remember the way the Princess smiled when she put that garland on your head. I remember the way that all of Jororun celebrated.

But no one else does.

** the caravan arrives

I don’t know when it happened. But the day the caravan came back was the day that I realized it had. It was three years [time? maybe later say, “a year is...”. Alt, disagreements about year lengths. “A year is how long a mouse lives...” “a year is ten rains...” etc.] after the celebration for you, and three months after you left to go on another adventure. It was the second time the caravan had come since your triumph.

I woke up excited for the caravan, for seeing silks and strange animals, for hearing the way the Ortherners speak. As I dressed, I took the bangle you gave me from the hook where I keep it and I slipped it onto my wrist. I remember that it looked odd to me somehow, and I took it off again and held it up and looked through it, and I remembered the way you looked when I looked at you through it. I put the bangle back on and I ran to the caravan.

On my way there, my mother called out to me, asked where I was going. I told her I was going to see the caravan, that I wanted to see the strange things they had brought from distant lands to trade. I wanted to hear stories. I even thought to myself, though I did not say to my mother, that I might hear a story of you, hear what you were doing. I knew only that you’d traveled South [caravan came from Orth], and I wondered where it was that you went, what it was that you were doing. My mother asked if this meant that I was counting on her to take care of the next goat feeding, and I sheepishly said yes. But she was kind and just smiled and told me to go.

It took a while to walk to the caravan. The hills, you know... I went up and down the hills and through the center of Jororun, and stepped through the mushrooms in the shadow of the tower. I saw some of my friends going the same direction, and I ran to join them. While we walked, we talked about the things we had seen at previous caravans, and things we had heard about, and things we hoped to see and hear at this one. One of my friends said his father traded for a knife that never broke, and another said they saw a stone from the dark mountain, that took light only from fire, and not the sun. They also sold good arrowheads, and fine strings and threads, and clothes that were so fine it was like having a better skin. One of my friends said he was going to ask if they knew any stories of Grorm, a great warrior, or of the Cave Princess [or King, etc], or of Wise Hyronaemus, or even older stories, as of Veladitou (these were stories which we knew already, but we liked to hear the way people from other hills told them). I thought again about you, and I asked my friends if there was anyone from Jororun they would ask about, but they said no. So I felt too embarrassed to say that I was going to ask the caravan people about you.

We got to the top of the hill, the one that’s two or three kem [?] from the road. Do you remember it? The shadow makes a triangle there. We got to the top of the hill, and we could see the caravan, all its sparkling green segments snaking their way through the South pass into Jororun. Already many people were there, and the caravan people had taken apart their train and lain their goods on blankets and cloths [older word?] for trading. I saw caravan people talking with our countrymen, and some helping tie goats together to trade, and some were drinking and wrestling. I saw also the town crier. [it’d be good to put a few, slightly weirder hooks in here]

We finally made it down to the outskirts of where the townspeople were trading with the caravan people, and me and my friends split up to go searching for the things we wanted. I walked around and listened to some men talking to each other. The caravan people were asking what the royal family had said about the weather. I didn’t stay to listen, because I had heard already that there wasn’t any storm in sight for the next three days [limit of King’s reliable sight?]. I walked around and looked at some of the other stalls and other things people were selling. I saw an old woman on a blanket with a bunch of mice she was selling. She didn’t have them locked up or tied or anything; they were just all sitting in neat little rows ont he blanket in front of her, and sometimes one of them would turn around and look at her like it was asking a question, and she’d just pat its head or give it a little seed to eat.

I also saw a man training bats, and another man, very young, selling Day flowers [latenoon flowers?]. It was really amazing, the things they had. The whole time until my next sleep, I didn’t ask about anything, I just walked around the caravan and all the people and watched them and looked at all the things people were trading and listened to everything they were telling each other. Before I got tired, my brother came by with a bowl of mushroom stew and we ate it while we sat on the little hill that’s just Nightward of the clearing and watched everyone.

My mother had me watch the goats for my next two sleeps while she took my young siblings to see the caravan. While I did this, Oxivl—he’s the next oldest in my family—came by with water and food again, and with tidings from our little siblings. Mother was having him run errands (she usually does), but he had gone fast and found some extra time to go by the storytellers at the caravan and learn some of their stories, and he related them to me as best he could. He’s not quite as good as they are, but he’s very close sometimes. He told me many stories that I’d known before and a few that I hadn’t, but he didn’t tell me the story of the Blue Boy. I was still feeling a little embarrassed, but I was getting impatient, so before the last sleep before I could go back, I asked him to tell it to me.

“I didn’t hear any story like that today,” he said.

“Oh. Well, can you tell it anyway? You do a good job.”

“I don’t know it.”

“Yes, you do. You’ve told it to me before.”

“You mean a story of the Blue Wanderer?”

“No. No, I mean the Blue Boy. The story about the Blue Boy and the living shadow.”

My brother got kind of strange look, like he was thinking hard.

“You mean the Blue Wanderer and the living shadow.”

“No, I don’t. That’s not—the Blue Wanderer’s not in that story. It’s the Blue Boy.”

“Who’s the Blue Boy?”

I glared at him, but he didn’t look like he was joking. He just looked confused.

“The Blue Boy. You know who he is.”

“Did you hear about him from the caravan people?”

“No, no, we’ve seen him. We’ve seen him lots of times.”

“When?”

“What are you talking about? You know who the Blue Boy is. You’ve seen him. He only lives twenty kem from here! By the shadow of the cave. We went to his parade!”

“Parade?”

“For killing the sta
tue! And he wrestled the living shadow!”

Oxivl just looked more and more confused.

“When was this parade?”

“Three years ago. You were there! Everyone was there! They came through the road. Even the Princess was there! He gave me this!” I shook the bangle at my brother.

“I thought you found that.”

I was taken aback for a moment, because I realized that I had told my family that I had found the bangle.

“Never mind the bangle. What about the statue? Who killed the statue?”

“I don’t know know what statue you’re talking about. Are you sure you don’t mean the Blue Wanderer? Odgar?”

“No! I don’t mean him. It’s his grandson, Ydgar.”

“Odgar never had a grandson.”

“Yes, he did!”

“Sidren, I don’t know what you’re talking about. Odgar’s son never had any children. I think you’re thinking of the Blue Wanderer.”

By this time I was so angry with Oxivl that I couldn’t think of anything to say, and I ignored him until he left, and I was so angry I didn’t have my last sleep. 

When my mother came back, I told her that Oxivl was lying to annoy me, and she told me she’d tell him off for it later. Then I headed back to the caravan. On the way, I met up with some of the other children who were waiting for a farmer, who was going to head off to the caravan with an empty cart to get some good dung. He had told the children they could ride in the cart on the way there. Brixt was there, I remember. When the farmer came back, we all jumped in the cart and it rolled towards the caravan.

Some of the kids had already been there and were talking about the things they’d seen and heard. Two of Brixt’s brothers—older boys, almost adults—were complaining that the caravan people wouldn’t give them any bits of sugarcane.

The one said, “I talked to the red-haired man, the one that looks like an old buck, and he told me I was too old for free food, and I’d have to trade if I wanted any sugar.”

The other said, “He said the same thing to me. And the woman with the big scar on her nose said I knew enough stories already and she wouldn’t tell me any.”

The one said, “That woman with the lame wolf, she’s even worse, she said she wouldn’t even tell me what the weather was like where they came from unless I gave her something in return.”

The other said, “I might not even go any more, what’s the point if they won’t give you anything?”

Brixt quickly said, “Maybe you should see if there’s any extra dung when the fill up this cart. Maybe if there’s extra, you can have it.” Everybody laughed except for her two brothers, who just gave her sour looks.

Some of the younger kids who hadn’t been to the caravn yet were talking and excited about what they might see and hear. I listened to them for a while. They were little kids, younger than Oxivl, and they mostly wanted the old stories that everyone knows, and that I was tired of. But they kept talking and talking, and one of them said he was going to ask the caravan people to tell the story of the Blue Wanderer. Brixt was talking with some of her friends her age, and her brothers were talking to each other quietly. I asked the little kids if they would ask for stories about the Blue Boy.

“Who’s that?” one of them said.

“The Blue Boy. Ydgar,” I said.

“Who?”

I was so annoyed that my brother would tell these kids to lie to me, too, just to get at me. But it seemed odd; Oxivl didn’t think up things like that. I looked at Brixt’s brothers, who were still talking with each other. But they never even talked to me; I didn’t think they would even care enough to play a joke on me. Then I looked at Brixt, and she was smirking at me, and I felt all hot and looked away. I realized what had happened. Brixt had told everyone else not to tell me the new stories about you. She was still jealous of the bangle you gave me. I saw how jealous she was on the day of the parade, and she was still jealous, and she was trying to hurt me because she didn’t have anything as good and lovely as the bangle you gave me. I didn’t say anything else or look at anyone until we got to the caravan.

When we got to the field where the caravan people had set up their stalls and everything, all the kids got out of the cart and went running in different directions. Brixt’s brothers went off together to look at clubs, and Brixt somewhere by herself. I went to the other end of the field, as far away from Brixt as I could. I was so angry with her. But I also felt almost happy. It was a good feeling that she was so jealous of me. Or, not a good feeling... but not quite a bad one, either. I don’t know.

I spent a while looking at some fine cloths of many colors, and there was a young man who had animals he’d made of wood. There were some twins who were juggling. Then I found an old, old woman who said she’d cut my hair if I told her a poem. I hadn’t had my hair cut in four days, so I told her a poem my mom made up for me and my sisters. The old old woman laughed and said she knew I hadn’t made that one up, but she liked it and she’d cut my hair. Her hands were bony against my head and made me shiver, and she used a white round thing instead of a flint knife, but she finished my whole head faster than my mother ever did, and she did a better job, too. She told me I looked like one of her great grandchildren, and I should kiss my mother the next time I saw her, and some of the other women in the caravan were gossips, and the white round thing was called a shell and that it once had an animal in it. When she was done she sharpened the shell and told me there was a man in the caravan who’d give me a special berry if I whispered something in his ear.

“What should I whisper?”

“Tell him he’s got slugs between his ears.”

I giggled, and the old old woman laughed and laughed.

When I found the man she meant (a huge and fierce-looking man who wore many brown cloths all on top of each other), I whispered this in his ear. He snorted like he thought it was funny, but not that funny. He turned away from me.

“The old woman who cut my hair told me...” I said.

“Eh?”

“She said you’d give—”

“Eh? You want a berry?”

I nodded, and he reached over to a little wooden box and pulled out a little dark blue berry and tossed it to me. I just barely caught it.

“Is it special?” I asked. It looked like a regular bilberry.

“Yes.”

“What’s it for?”

“Eating.” He looked like he was done talking to me, so I left. He was a very big man. When he was out of sight, I ate the berry. It tasted like a regular bilberry.

When I was bored of walking around I found some of the little kids from the cart sitting in a circle, listening to a woman telling stories. She wore big pieces of bark on her front and back tied together with strings, and painted so many colors that it made her look like a big moth. Her nose had a big ugly scar on the side. When I sat down to listen, she was telling the children a story I had heard before, the story of Kind Illing. Do you know it? When Kind Illing was just a farmer, he overheard his chief making bargains with Nightmen to give them all the village’s little children in return for spices and gems. The chief caught Illing and contrived to have him stoned, but a pack of wolves took pity on Illing and came and drove everyone away, and dragged the chief into the middle of the town and made marks to show the village what the chief was doing, so they stoned him instead and made Illing their chief, and when the Nightmen came back Illing and the wolves drove them away.

She did a good job of it, making growls for the wolves that sounded just like real ones, and making such an ugly face for the evil [wicked] chief that some of the little children screamed.

When she was done with that story, she asked what story she should tell next. All of the children yelled different things, and one of them yelled for the story of Aimee and the little statues. Then she said she’d tell one more story. The little children were all shouting again, and I knew I should let them pick, but I couldn’t help myself, and I called out to her to tell the story of the Blue Boy and the living shadow. With all the children shouting, she misheard me and thought I asked for a story about the Blue Wanderer. But then she told the story of the living shadow, but with odd changes, and putting the Blue Wanderer in place of the Blue Boy.

This was very strange to me. I guessed that Brixt had told her to be in on the joke, too, but I didn’t think that Brixt could make this woman tell a wrong story. She was a good storyteller, and loved to tell stories just to hear the children laugh and see their big eyes, and I don’t think she’d care about what a girl of 16 years [?] told her to do, and I didn’t think she’d ever remember a story wrong. So I started to wonder if something was wrong, if there was some reason not to talk about the Blue Boy that I didn’t know about. And I got scared, because I remembered that when my father was killed, my mother didn’t want to talk about it for years and years, and would make us be quiet if we tried. And I got scared because I thought maybe there was news that you had died, and the Princess or someone had told everyone not to talk about you, and to talk like you were never real. And I thought what an awful thing this was, and especially awful because nobody would tell me, but just let me find out by thinking about it.

When the woman was done with her stories, she shooed all the children away and untied her colored bark outfit and went to walk back to her part of the caravan. I didn’t know if I was supposed to, since she was done with her stories and had sent the children away and all, but while she was walking I went to walk with her and talk with her. She looked back at me while she was walking.

“Hello, girl,” she said. “Did you like my stories?”

“Yes, thank you. You did a fine job.”

“Much obliged.”

“I wanted to ask you something. About the last story you told.”

“You asked for the story of the moving shadow. One of the Blue Wanderer stories.

“No. I mean, I asked for a story of the Blue Boy...”

“Yes. I hadn’t heard that name for Odgar.”

“I didn’t mean Odgar. I meant his grandson.”

“Odgar never had any grandchildren.”

I might’ve said, “Yes, he did,” but she sounded so sure that for a moment I doubted myself. I said, “What about Ydgar?”

“Odgar named his son Udgar. All his rest were girls. I don’t know about them. Udgar never had any wife or any children.”

“He hasn’t... he hasn’t died, has he?” I said, scared.

She frowned at me. “Odgar’s long dead. I don’t know about his son...”

“No, no. Ydgar. Did he die?”

“I haven’t heard of anyone with that name.”

This was so strange to me that I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know this woman, but she was clearly a good storyteller and knew many things, and she said she didn’t know you at all. And I was sure Brixt couldn’t have convinced her to be in on her mean joke, and it didn’t seem to be because you were dead. I wanted to keep asking her about you, but I felt like I couldn’t figure out how ot ask the same question in a different way, so I asked her if she knew about the statue you had killed.

“Do you mean that one in Breteld? We just came from there, a few weeks [?] ago. I talked with their physician, he told me all about it. It was a bad thing.”

“But who killed it?”

She frowned further and stared off into the distance, and after a while she said, “I don’t remember. One of the townspeople, I think. A tall man.”

“What was his name?”

“It was Cuyer. No, Kern. Or... I don’t remember. I’ll have to ask the next time I’m in Breteld.

Then we were back at the caravan [beetle? wagon? etc?], and she was talking with some of the other caravan people, and it seemed like she didn’t want to talk with me anymore, and I was feeling very confused and unsure of myself, so I left.

While I was walking, I saw Jeen, a friend of mine. She and a messenger were running to the caravan, and I ran to mee them. I wanted someone familiar to talk to, someone who would listen to me and who wouldn’t make mean jokes.

“Hey, Sidren,” Jeen she said when she saw me. “Do you know where the caravan driver is?”

“At the front of the caravan?” I said. “I don’t know. Why are you looking for them?”

“Message,” said the messenger.

“From the king,” added Jeen. She was training to be a messenger. They 

“What is it?”

“The weather.”

“Don’t the caravan people know how to tell the weather?”

“Not here. They know how to do it other places. They asked for weather tidings every two sleeps.”

“They’ll know,” said the messenger, pointing at a group of people some ways off. He and Jeen got ready to run again.

“Can you wait a moment?” I said.

Jeen looked at the messenger, who said, “Just for a minute.”

“Are you okay?” said Jeen.

“Yeah, I’m okay. I just need someone friendly to talk to. I think someone’s been playing a mean trick on me.”

“What kind of trick?”

“A sleep ago I was talking with Oxivl, and I asked him to tell me the story of the Blue Boy. But he kept saying he didn’t know who the Blue Boy was. Just a few moments ago, I listened to one of the caravan women telling stories, and I asked her about Blue Boy and the statue, and she said that it wasn’t him. She said she’d never heard of the Blue Boy. I think Brixt’s told them them to say so. But it’s awfully mean of Oxivl, and I don’t know how she got the caravan woman to say it. I feel like everyone’s laughing at me.”

“I don’t think they’re laughing at you. They probably just don’t know what you mean.”

“I just wanted to hear the story! That’s all.”

“Which story did you want to hear?”

“The Blue Boy.”

“Which story is that?”

Something hot was in my chest.

“I asked for the story with the shadow. But I just wanted a story about the Blue Boy.”

“...Who’s the Blue Boy?”

The hot thing in my chest got hotter and started to fill me up. Suddenly I wanted to cry and hit Jeen. How could she be so mean to me? Oxivl and I get along, but he’s my brother. Sometimes he does mean things, the way brothers do. And I didn’t know anything about that awful caravan woman. But Jeen was my friend. We told each other secrets when we were alone together.

“Jeen, you know who the Blue Boy is.”

“No, I don’t. Do you mean the Blue Wanderer?”

I punched her on the arm. She yelped and jumped back.

“Calm down, calm down,” said the messenger.

“Sid!” said Jeen. “Why’d you do that?”

“It’s not fair! Everyone’s lying to me! It’s a bad joke!”

“Calm down!” said the messenger [should just name him? small community, etc.?] again. He looked from me, shaking and with my hands in fists, to Jeen, holding her arm and looking very hurt, back to me. “What’s the matter, Sidren?”

“Everyone’s lying to me!” I said again. Jeen’s eyes made me want to feel bad but I ignored the feeling.

“Lying about what?”

“About Ydgar! Everyone’s saying they don’t know who he is. Every time I say Blue Boy they say I mean Blue Wanderer.”

“They think you mean Odgar?”

“Yes!”

“And who do you mean?”

“Ydgar!”

“Who’s Ydgar?”

It’s odd, but I can remember exactly what I felt when he said that. I was looking at Jeen, but when he said, ‘Who’s Ydgar?’, I turned and looked at him, and he wasn’t smiling or laughing, he just had a bit of a frown, and I remember that before I felt anything else, my hands very suddenly like I’d put them in cold water. I don’t know what I thought. I couldn’t even think of anything to think. After a while the messenger repeated his question, and I said, “Odgar’s grandson.”

“I didn’t know Odgar had any grandsons [vs grandchildren?].”

I think if I hadn’t already yelled at Jeen I might have yelled at him. But with both of them there, staring at me, looking so confused, I realized that they weren’t lying. They really didn’t know who I was talking about. And what if the caravan woman hadn’t been lying, either? What about Oxivl?

I ran away from Jeen and the messenger and ran until I got to the small square. I looked around while I caught my breath. There weren’t many people there, since most of them were at the caravan, but there was woman with her little children, and some men.

I asked all of them. I went up to every one of them and asked them. None of them knew your name or who you were.

I ran home, and found Oxivl with my other brothers and sisters. I didn’t want to talk to him then, so I just asked where my mom was, and he said she was watching the goats, so I ran to find her. When I did, I asked her if she knew who the Blue Boy, or Ydgar, were. She said she didn’t. Then I started crying, and I cried more than I had since I was little. I cried so much that my mother held me until I fell asleep.

** Sidren investigates

After I was done crying, and after I woke up, I asked everyone I could find. No one remembered you. They didn’t remember your name, or your nickname, and they all thought that your dad never had any children. When I asked about the living shadow, they all said that it was your grampa who did it. But when I asked about the statue in Breteld, some people said that one of the townspeople of Breteld had killed it, and some said that it was a nomad warrior, and one person even said that it was a different statue, that there were two statues killing each other. The last person I asked about the statue was old man Zwer. I don’t know if you saw what happened with that finger you brought back from the statue, but I guess the Princess wanted it to be someone who people could look at it, because she gave it to old man Zwer and he made a cage for it. He had to use pretty big sticks, too, so it couldn’t get out. I thought maybe old man Zwer might remember that you were the one that killed the statue. [per later note: show, rather than tell, about asking other people about the statue]

When I asked him, he thought for a while, then said, “The Blue Wanderer.”

If I hadn’t already asked everyone else, I would have thought he was joking. “But the Princess gave you the finger just three years ago.”

“Yes.”

“And the statue was killed just a week before that.”

“Yes.”

“...And the Blue Wanderer died more than forty years ago.”

“Yes.”

“That doesn’t make sense.”

“It’s because he... I’m having trouble remembering... I think he’s the one who taught the warrior how to kill it. Yes, now I recall. That’s it. Odgar taught that warrior he met while he was wandering, so the warrior knew how to kill the statue. But when he’d done it... he said—he said that he couldn’t have done it without that he was told how, so it was really the Blue Wanderer who killed that statue, and not him.”

Until now, I had been experiencing the strange and dreadful fear that I had somehow gone crazy or imagined you, or been put under some strange influence. I everyone I asked said that your previous adventure had belonged to your grandfather; and they all remembered it the same way, and they said it like they’d say anything else that they knew. But the way Old Zwer told his story, it sounded like he didn’t know the story the way he knew other stories. And he’s old, but he remembers things.

I didn’t think he was lying to me. But the way he talked made me think that he had forgotten you. Not that you were never real in the first place, but that he had forgotten you.

[Maybe add exactly one other person who Sidren can ask about the statue, or about some other tale, such that she can find a disagreement between them? Or, find one person to ask about the statue, who (due to isolation) lacks sufficient information to make the same logical leap as everyone else? Then add in a Show as to why Sidren believes Zwer is sincere, rather than making it a straight Tell? Tough stuff!]

I didn’t know anymore what to say to people who said these strange things, and I was tired of all the strange looks and people think I was joking or trying to make trouble, so I didn’t say anything more. I looked at the finger, which had curled around itself like a sleeping snake. Then I left.

[
I watched the statue’s finger a bit more. It kept sticking its thin front part out between the bars and trying to get at me and old man Zwer, but its back was too thick and it would get stuck. Finally I guess it got tired, because it curled up around itself eight times, like a snake.
]

[
One more thing occured to me. Old Zwer was to a lot of places when he was younger, and he remembers a lot. I thought about the bangle. Old Zwer wouldn’t know about how I got it, but maybe he’d know something about where you got it. I held up my wrist.

“What can you tell me about this bangle?”

Old Zwer peered at it, then held out his palm for it. It’s stupid, but I didn’t like giving it to him. It was the best proof, at least to me [!], that you were real. But I handed it to him, and he scrutinized it closely. Then he shrugged and said, “It’s made of wood.”

“Is there anything strange about it?”

“No. Not that I can see.”

I took the bangle back and put it on my wrist.
]

I walked out of Old Zwer’s house and down the hill towards the rest of town [geography?], staying just outside of the shadow of the hill. While I walked, I again held up the bangle and looked through it. I could almost imagine that I still saw you through it, smiling. I held it up to the sun and squinted through it so that I could barely see, and it was easier to imagine that I still saw you. I thought of the way you had looked that day. I thought of the way you’d looked every day. You stood so tall in that handsome blue tunic. I thought about your voice, and tried to hear it in my head.

Some months [time?] ago, I was in the big valley. My mom send me there with one of my sisters to bring a gift [PH] to the King. She and I had walked all day to get to the big valley and were resting at the foot of the mountain, near the gardens, and having some hardbread we’d brought, and we saw you walking through one of the gardens with one of the mountain guards. He was holding his mace/club just under the head and was turning it in slow, easy circles, and was laughing at what you were telling him. I could just barely hear his laughter over the sound of the wind [geography?]. I couldn’t hear your story at all, but I could see you moving your hands to make your story better. I could tell it wa s a good story, and I wanted to go an dlisten to it, and hear your voice again, and I thought maybe you’d remember me, but my sister was nervous for being at the royal mountain, and I needed to stay with her and help her keep her wits. ...That was the last day I’d seen you.


Investigation progression:
Asking everyone > realizing there are differing opinions > decides to check Ydgar’s family (none), house (difficult to say which is his) > winds up at the cave > at conclusion of conversation with the Princess, has actual, sort-of clue as to Ydgar’s direction > hears news about caravan leaving; Princess hands over hatchet as bargaining chip; Sidren dispenses lie with sibling/messenger, and goes wit the caravan


(Yd lived in the big town, a bit of a walk from Sid’s “suburb”; she didn’t know where his house was, plus it was far, which was why she didn’t immediately go and check there; when she gets there, it seems... abandoned? Includes some clue as to his whereabouts...)

While I walked away from Old Zwer’s house, I again held the bangle up and looked through it. I imagined 


(At some point, there may be various memories from Sid's life between the parade and the forgetfulness.
Special emphasis on the last times Sidren saw Ydgar, and heard someone else reference him, before the forgetfulness.
Reference by Ydgar (not said directly to Sidren; heard by her, first- or second- or third-hand) to planning further exploits in the future (with or without detail).)


that’s when it hit me...

I didn’t know what to do. I had asked everyone I really trusted, and no one seemed to remember you. I tried asking some of them about the bangle, but I had always lied about where I got it, so that didn’t help. 


more valuable information worth more... heard more stories... pay more to hear a story other people hadn’t heard...

a guard or servant or helper takes Sidren to see the Princess. The Princess is reciting poetic history. Says Sidren’s name. Sidren blurts out, “It’s true.” “What’s true?” “You really know everyone’s name.” Princess smiles. “Actually, the guard told me. Amongst all the royal family and guards, everyone in Jororun is remembered. I didn’t know you specifically, but I am given to remember the dead, so I remember your father.” (Might even recite a bit of poetry? If so, this would be the way to reveal to Sidren and the audience that they’re not literal, because then she’d hear the euphemism for her father’s cause of death)

One day, I picked it up and it seemed ... odd ... I couldn't remember where it came from... but I looked though it, and I remembered you."

** meeting Guipathorme

Sidren finally finds Guipathorme, and sees that Brixt, another girl from Jororun, has also joined up, and happens to be talking with Guipathorme already, about some other quest. Guipathorme tells Sidren a bit about thaumaturgical amnesia, and implies that the bangle is significant. Sidren lies to Brixt about what she’s looking for.

Brixt tells Sidren that she’s looking for “something my mom lost”. 
Sidren tells Brixt that she’s ... looking for where the bangle came from, or looking for the person who gave it to her, or looking for trees...
Sidren stays with Brixt because ...
Brixt stays with Sidren because ...

** the Fort

Upon being distracted by finding Ivearnoun’s Entrusted badge of office, Brixt falls down a hole or something. Sidren takes the badge and ends up inadvertently showing it to Ivearnoun.

** escaping the fort

Sidren does not mention the cells as being frightening; might even comment to the contrary. In part 2, she'll be afraid of them, or at least of returning to them, though of course she can't remember why.
Ydgar doesn't register Sidren's ignoring of the other people, the first time, either because she passed them first, and didn't go back for them, or (more likely), she dragged him past them while he was unconscious.
Ydgar did not have contact with the other prisoners while in the fort, otherwise he would have written their names down somehow.
Ydgar (and the other prisoners) have a good idea of how the fort works - as good as the people (if any) who use the fort, and slightly better than Ivearnoun's educated guesses.

** the cart ride

Sidren remembers the other prisoners while she is on the cart with Ydgar, but she lies and says there was no one else. Since Part 1 is told to Ydgar, this lie is told to the reader, as well. In the events of the first part of Part 2, she has forgotten the prisoners, but harbors subconscious guilt. I have to figure out how this meshes with the mechanism and formulas for amnesia magic.

Sidren’s lie to Ydgar becomes a lie to herself, since she knows (or is pretty sure) she will forget the prisoners.

** low point

The cart is stopped by some trouble before it can reach Temperance (or a place near Temperance). Sidren takes care of the trouble, then carries Ydgar until she basically collapses. Temperance finds them, and utters the name “Blue Boy”.

** Ivearnoun revealed

Temperance remembers and reveals herself as Ivearnoun. Heals Ydgar (and Sidren). In so doing, alerts her enemies to her presence. Sidren and Ydgar flee as Ivearnoun defends herself. They realize that the whole dang army is going to come after Ivearnoun. Also, a storm is coming. Sidren tries to get Ydgar to come back to Jororun with her, but he insists they return to the Fort to rescue Brixt (or recover her body).
The Act must portend mysterious or dark things. For instance, maybe Guipathorme or someone said, “The great Practitioners would hang on to their pocket spells for decades, maybe longer, and use them only when danger was very great... especially healing spells...” or something.
Ydgar going back to the fort must seem WORSE than getting away from the fort with him injured.
"She had reason to hide her true name, and likewise to temper her true power... And so, when they asked her who she was, she said not, 'I am Ivearnoun', but rather, 'I am Temperance".
"They will tell you that names have no power, and other such lies..."

** the fort again

They find clues that Brixt survived her fall, and almost made her way out; but then they find her body. While leaving with it, they encounter the other captives, who Sidren then remembers. They distrust her, but take to Ydgar, and they all escape (or try to) together.
Ydgar has a map of the fort, made or found during his stay. He didn't bring it out during the first rescue due to how out of sorts he was.

** Sidren seeks forgiveness

Including asking Ydgar whether Brixt forgives her.

* ROUGH DRAFT
** Chapter 01

Sidren recalls the first time she met Ydgar: the city [village?] of Jororun was having a parade for him, because he had gone and defeated an evil "statue" in the province of Tercrest [?]. She recalls the crowd, a crier, Ydgar himself seated on a caribou, the Princess coming down to pay her respects... and she remembers how Ydgar gave her a wooden bangle shaped like a teardrop (possibly after she'd given him a flower). He said nothing, but only handed it to her, and she sort of fell in love with him them (she was ~11 and he ~13, at the time). She noticed Brixt (a bit older) glaring at her, but didn't care. As Ydgar turned to ride on, Sidren held up the bangle by its point and watched him through it.
During the parade, Ydgar is christened the "Blue Boy", in honor of his later grandfather Odgar, who had various adventures for which he was named "The Blue Wanderer". Some say that Ydgar is his grandfather returned.

"But no one else [remembers you]."

** Chapter 02

It was the day the caravan came to town, came from the South. Like all the days when the caravan came to the town, everyone was very excited, and everyone was doing something. All the children liked the caravan because it meant new sights and stories and strangers, and all the adults needed the caravan to trade (Jororun produced only goat products (wool, meat, milk), flint things, and maybe a few wolf pelts or whatever, but almost nothing else. They needed to trade for everything else). As Sidren went with some of the other village children, they discussed what stories they would ask the storyteller for. Sidren is (slightly) miffed when no one else recognizes her suggestion of a story of the Blue Boy. They don't remember the Blue Boy, and think she's talking about the Blue Wanderer. She thinks they're just being difficult on purpose, so she's not really worried.

Sidren and the others go to the caravan and have a grand old time. Sidren sees everything she can, talks with people, spends what little she has to trade (money is unknown here, or at least not used in Jororun; she'll have traded some little things she made, flint knives or arrowheads or baskets or decorations) for treats or cloth or something. Maybe linen. She spends a couple hours there, and then goes back to her house to do chores, watch her younger siblings, etc. Later, she returns to the carvan, gets a haircut, and she (and many other children) meet the storyteller, a woman from Tercrest, where the caravan passed through recently. The storyteller tells some stories. Includes a brief mention like, "Orth of here - where this very caravan shall travel 'ere we are best by a storm - " {caravan}. Sidren asks for the story of the Blue Boy, but the storyteller (apparently) mishears her and tells her the story of the Blue Wanderer instead. Later, Sidren gets in an argument with her best friend about the existence of the Blue Boy, and indeed the existence of the evil statue in Tercrest (those who didn't see the statue firsthand have forgotten it along with Ydgar {amnesia}); then, Sidren has the chance to ask the storyteller directly about the BB - she's confident the storyeller will know him, since she's from Tercrest -, and the storyteller tells her that Odgar's son never had any children. Sidren is shocked by this. She asks the storyteller about the statue. The storyteller does remember the statue, having seen it herself when it injured/killed her, one of her family, one of her animals, something like that. Something vivid. Sidren asks her who defeated the statue, and the storyteller thinks for a moment, and then confabulates something; says it was a brave, manly warrior.

# around here is where it's mentioned that the basic code of the caravan people is to exchange rather than give. E.g., help solidify Sidren's later rationale that she will not be permitted to join the caravan unless she has something of value to give them.

Sidren is dismayed by this, and goes and asks her mother and some other people about Ydgar; no one remembers him, and other Jororuners don't remember the statue. Sidren has an opportunity to have the Storyteller talk with someone else about the statue, but that gets no where; the other person simply accepts the Storyteller's story. Insofar as she's brave enough and has opportunity enough to talk to the other caravaners, they're either not from Tercrest, or don't remember the statue (and none know of the Blue Boy). Sidren begins carrying her bangle with her everywhere. Eventually she speaks with Old Zwer, the local natural philosopher, who thinks that everything's made of Light (or Air, or whatever) {philosophy}. Zwer does remember the statue, because he was also in Tercrest a while ago. And Sidren goes to Zwer last because at this point she's afraid she imagined the Blue Boy, and there really was a statue but she only heard about it from Zwer (which she did, originally). So she goes to Zwer to hear about the statue again. And he remembers it, but he gives a completely different explanation of its defeat: maybe he says it was destroyed by a ray of purest Light from the Sun, or from the Emperor, or something. This is a hint for Sidren {amnesia}, and she reasons that either Zwer or the storyteller, or both, are either lying or deceived. 

** Chapter 03

The Big hill, which is a 4 hour walk from Sid's family's farm, is the capital (such as it is) of Jororun, and is also next to the Royal Cave, where the Royal Family (or Court, or whatever) reside. Sidren thinks that Ydgar probably lives on the Big Hill [or does she forget?], and she wants to look for him, though she doesn't know exactly how she'll do that. She also has, in the back of her mind, the idea of visiting the Royal Family and asking them about Ydgar.

Sidren has one memory of the Royal Family: years ago, she and some of her family (including her mother) went to the cave to beg for charity, on account of the death of Sid's father, the young age of Sid and her siblings, and times in general being hard. Sid has few memories of her father, as he died when she was 6, and he was away soldiering for much of her life from age 3-6 (he was a very brave and formidable soldier, though not perhaps the greatest father and husband). Sid has a feeling that her memory was not the only time her mother petitioned the Royal Family for charity, but it's the only time she actually knows about. Because of her memory, she thinks of the Royal Family as patient and generous, and it's common knowledge that they (or some of them, or some combination of them) know about every person and event in Jororun. They also would have the ability to send someone off in search of Ydgar, though Sidren is unsure even where such a person would begin looking.

Sidren tries to think of an excuse to go to the Big Hill. She overheard at the caravan that some caravan people were hiring (paying with some sort of good) strong boys for some job at the Big Hill [or maybe ferrying things to and from the Big Hill]. She lies to her mother, and tells her that she also was offered this {lie} (she's not sure exactly how she'll explain this to her mother when she gets back, but she thinks maybe she'll give up the linen she got for herself, and tell her mother that that was her payment). Her mother readily agrees, but insists that Sidren takes her eldest brother along with her to help. Sidren's mother says "If they're taking girls, they'll take a young boy". Because of Sidren's lie, Sidren is unable to contradict this reasoning.

They take a walking path, which is shorter than a different path which is good for wagons/animals/etc. She tells her brother that the person who wanted her help at the caravan went to the Big Hill and actually needs her help there. Sidren is anxious about taking her little brother all the way to the Big Hill by herself, but tells herself that she'll make it quick, and maybe they can catch a wagon going back [?]. They walk to the Big Hill. When they get there, Sidren stalls. She wants to look for Ydgar (under the guise of looking for her supposed contact with the caravan), but she doesn't know where to begin. She goes to the main street, where the parade was, since that's her only memory of Ydgar. When she goes there, she suddenly sees a house and remembers another memory of him. She remembers that on a previous visit [maybe the one when she and her mother went for charity? probably not], she saw Ydgar and a guard outside that house, and overheard them talking. She overheard Ydgar saying that for his next adventure, he was going to find trees, and bring one back {Ydgar}. He talked about the good wood that's used for handles, walking sticks, buckets, etc, even the driftwood that floated down the river from the Orth, which the Jororuners dried in the sun and burned. He said that everyone knew that wood came from trees, and if he brought one back and they had a tree of their own, they would have all the wood they'd ever need.

Sidren remembers this, and this is her next hint about amnesia {amnesia}; because although she FEELS like she never forgot it, she knows she did, because otherwise she wouldn't have wandered around not knowing why she was there [this one shouldn't be watertight - some doubt about the the narrator's effective honesty is inevitable, anyway). Sidren suspects that the house is Ydgar's, but she doesn't know. She snoops around a bit, but the door [(curtain?[ is closed and she's reluctant to go in. It looks empty. She asks a random passer-by if anyone lives in the house, and the person's says "Of course someone lives in there." But he doesn't know the man's name. So Sidren leaves it alone.

Sidren feels like she's on to something, but she also feels the pressure of time, and her brother asking about [getting suspicious about?] the alleged job. She thinks that pretty soon she's going to have to either fess up to him, or call it quits and tell him that she just couldn't her find the caravan person. Then her brother says, "Look, there they are," indicating one of the caravan cars that's unexpectedly coming from the caravan path. Sidren realizes that once they check with the caravan, there'll be no getting out of the fact that there's no job at all, and maybe her brother will tattle on her and she'll be in trouble with her mother. In desperation, she tells her brother to go to the caravan car and ask about the job, while she checks at the royal cave for the same reason. Her brother is confused by this fairly flimsy pretense, but she shoos him away and rushes to cave, unsure of herself and full of anxiety.

The dirt field in front of the entrance of the cave is in shadow, and chilly. There's one guard on duty, and he's playing a song or something, his club near at-hand. Sidren approaches him. She figures, in for a penny in for a pound, and boldly tells him that she has need of the royal family: she's looking for a friend. The guard is kind but asks her why this is a matter for the royal family. She says that her friend was a friend of the royal family, a good friend of all Jororun, and the loss of him would be quite tragic. He asks her who this person is, and she says, with scant hope, "Ydgar, grandson of Odgar." The guard is a bit nonplussed by this (he happens to know of Odgar, but it would not have been his duty to memorize Ydgar). He asks her what happened to him, why she thinks he's in trouble.^ Sidren is evasive or vague. Eventually the guard tells her to stay put while he goes inside and checks on something. He's gone for a few minutes, and before he gets back, Sidren sees her brother coming to get her, much earlier than she expected (this is because her brother went and found the caravan already on its way out of town). Not wanting that confrontation, she goes into the cave after the guard, and quickly becomes lost. It is dark and she can hear voices saying strange things. She begins to panic about what the cave is and the nature of the royal family, and she reminds herself that she needs only to [be honest and] ask that someone be sent Orth to look for Ydgar. The guard finds her, and chides her for her impatience, but says the Princess [he might not actually name her] will see him, but she has to wait, and be silent. Sidren overhears the Princess reciting one of her many memory tasks. Then she talks with her.

# around here is where the soldier or Princess first mentions the oncoming storm {storm}

** Chapter 04

First, Sidren can't help but ask whether what the Princess was reciting was true (the Princess was reciting some euphemistic history). The Princess says something like it is and isn't, and very briefly describes what the words she was saying actually meant (maybe just a comment about dreaming of the forest = burning the body). The Princess asks her what she wants, noting that the guard told her she was looking for someone [note that the guard did NOT tell Princess Ydgar's name or even sex, since he forgot by the time he got to the Princess. Be subtle about drawing attention to this.].

Sidren tries to explain things to the Princess, and describes Ydgar and uses his name. The Princess is sympathetic but unconvinced. It was the Princess' duty to remember Ydgar, and she has no memory of such an obviously important and contemporary person. When Sidren asks about Ydgar's house, the Princess tells her that it was Odgar's house, and has been empty since he died and his son was banished. The kind had said (to his family, at least) that the house, which was (as of Odgar's service) in a place of honor, would be kept as it was (empty and in good repair) until a worthy successor to Odgar came around [whether or not of his line?].

Sidren asks her to repeat this (the confabulation), that the house was last Odgar's/Udgar's, and that it was now empty. She turns to the guard, and asks him, and he confirms this. The Princess, losing patience, tells Sidren that she simply had a dream (Sidren grips the bangle but knows it won't convince the Princess [alternatively, she shows the bangle to the Princess, who is unimpressed by it]), and should leave; Sidren desperately asks the guard to go fetch someone else, anyone else, but not tell them what she'd been talking about. The Princess allows it, and the guard leaves. While he's gone, Sidren asks the Princess to ask whoever the guard brings back about the house, and if that person says the same thing as the Princess and the guard, then she (Sidren) will be satisfied (that she had a dream) and leave [it's possible that she also mentally reiterates, in shorthand, while the guard is away, that when she is proven right, she must ask the Princess to send him, or someone like him, Orth to find Ydgar]. The guard returns with gets Brixt, who is either a tertiary member of the court, or just had business nearby. The Princess asks Brixt about the house in the place of honor. Brixt says that the house is used as ae halfway house for important travelers.

The Princess is surprised that Brixt got this "wrong", and gives her own "memory" of the house. Brixt agrees that this makes sense, then seems confused. She feels strongly that the house has been for travelers, but she cannot name any of the travelers who stayed in it. Yet she still seems sure, and she mentions that sometimes when she passes the house, the curtains are open, and sometimes, closed. This makes the Princess stop and think, because she has the same memory, but doesn't know why the curtains would be opening and closing if no one lived there. Since the Princess' main job right now is memory, she's very good at it, and these conflicts concern her greatly. She turns to Sidren again and says, "And this traveler who you say lived there..." and Sidren again tells her about Ydgar, the grandson of Odgar.

Sidren had been hoping, now that the Princess seemed more sympathetic to her, that the Princess might send someone after Ydgar; but she's starting to suspect {amnesia} that other people can't remember even what she tells them about him. So the only one would be able to even attempt to search for Ydgar would be herself. So when the Princess asks what she wants done, she doesn't say what she was preparing to say, what she's been formulating in her mind, which by now is something like "I want you to send someone loyal and brave to the Orth, to trees, to search for Ydgar, and discover what has happened to him, and return with him if possible". Instead, she says "I want to find him." [she might also have this revelation while talking, and say it as part of her speech, rather than as an answer to her question. E.g., the Princess says, "Tell me again who this traveler is, and what you want done with him?" and Sidren ends her speech with "...and I want to go and find him." They all kind of stare at her, and the Princess asks her how she's going to do that. Sidren says that she knows where he was going - to find trees. 

# This is a big moment for Sidren. There's nothing magical about it, but it's the moment when she turns and makes the first part of the full decision to be proactive and search for Ydgar herself. More justification, self- and otherwise, will come later.

The Princess says, "He was close to you?" and Sidren says, "He's important to me." Sidren's really thinking, no one else can do it, but she's too timid to say it aloud, so she implies a greater relationship between herself and Ydgar than there really is; she thinks, if she's the only one who can remember him, maybe there IS some sort of bigger connection between them.

# much later on, she will learn/realize that the only reason she remembered Ydgar was the bangle, and the only reason he gave her the bangle was whim.

So, Sidren says that Ydgar is going to search for trees, and she may be able to find him if she knows where trees are. The soldier comments that trees are "everywhere, if you go far enough". Sidren responds by asking where the nearest trees are, the best way to get to them. The soldier and Princess make some noncommittal responses, then Brixt speaks up that she should follow the river Orth to where the driftwood comes from. The same way the caravan is going.

# alternatively, it's soldier or Princess who suggests this, and Brixt is then jealous because she's been looking for an excuse to go to that village, herself

Sidren, a little giddy, thinks she can go with the caravan, since she knows that's the direction it's going. She talks for a bit longer, about how her mother and family will be alright, and she can talk with the caravan people to find a way to barter into their journey, and then eventually barter a way back on one of the much rarer South-traveling convoys, or something... (conveniently leaving out the lies she'll have to tell her mother) She says that to buy her passage on the caravan, she could convince one of the caravaners that she would be a good helper, or could tend the animals, or even do some menial labor like basket weaving. The Princess interrupts her to say that it's too late, as the caravan has already left. This takes Sidren completely off guard. The Princess epxplains that the King suddenly saw a large storm, due to arrive in just a day or two [time], and the caravaners want to get past Jororun so that they don't get caught in it [this is either because they prefer the greater safety of the larger city Orth of Jororun, or because there is a pass beyond Jororun that is likely to become long-term impassible after a big storm, like a river that will flood. Something like that.] Sidren thinks back to the caravan she saw by the Big Hill just a few minutes ago, and something prompts a little bit of insanity in her, and she asks if she can still catch them. The others say, "What about your family?" etc. Sidren makes up some excuse or lie about them. She's about to run out of the cave when she realizes and laments that she has nothing of value for the caravaners - that she won't have the opportunity to impress any of them with her meager skills as a shepherdess/etc, nor to get anything of value from her home. The Princess considers for just a moment and then gives Sidren the hatchet from her own belt (or wall, or whatever [make sure it's mentioned earlier]). She briefly describes it, says that it should be valuable enough to gain passage for her, and wishes her good speed. Specifically, the Princess implies that if Sidren is unable to join the caravan, or chickens out, she can return the hatchet.

Sidren rushes out of the cave and runs right into her brother, whom she had forgotten. He tells her that he tried to talk to the caravan people, but they said they weren't accepting any more help of the kind that Sidren had mentioned, not least because they were now leaving. He's asking her questions about what's going on and saying they need to get back home, and Sidren's annoyance with him and reluctance to deal with everything spur her sudden craziness and she decides to ditch him and go find the caravan. She gives him a story [really not sure what, nor how much of it is true], and runs off in the direction of the caravan.

# regarding the story she gives her brother - I think there's a lie that begins with her excuse to visit the Big Hill in the first place, and becomes larger, and when she sees her brother again, she doubles down, says that she accepted a position with someone - something hinted at earlier. This is the big lie she's told her mother.

** Chapter 05

Sidren joins the caravan. She ran the last bit and is out of breath when she arrives. The caravan people give her some time. They then make an assumption about her presence which leads her naturally to lie about why she's with them - she does not get around to even offering the hatchet. After traveling with them just a little bit, maybe only a day, the storm the King saw hits, and they all shelter somewhere. Near the beginning of the storm, they admit Brixt, who arrived late and was almost killed by exposure to the storm. Brixt gains entrance partly by claiming to be a friend of Sidren and on the same business. This irks Sidren, but she feels obliged to go along with it (in her mind, this is deceipt; in Brixt's, it is not). We find that Brixt tried to convince the Princess to let her follow Sidren with an animal - both to make it on time, and to barter with the caravan people. This argument was hampered by the fact that Brixt and the Princess did not quite remember Sidren's story correctly (they may even have disagreed about it). Eventually, the Princess did allow Brixt to leave, but did not give her an animal. Consequently, Brixt had to travel a larger distance than Sidren, and was late, almost not making it.

Caravan people's reaction to Sidren, before and after Brixt arrives? Why do they let her join them?
-They like Sidren.
--because she offered the hatchet (though they did not accept it)
--because she offered the hatchet (Which they accepted - she gets it back later)
--because they know her
--because one of them knows her or her family in particular
--because of some lie she tells them (?)
-They don't care about Sidren
--Anyone's free to join

In othe words, there's a reason they are less willing to accept Brixt than Sidren, and why Sidren's word helps Brixt:
-They know Sidren, but not Brixt
-Sidren gives/offers the hatchet, but Brixt has nothing to offer
-Sidren tells a lie; Brixt could tell the same lie, but doesn't (THIS combined with something else)

Sidren does not get around to offering the hatchet. 

-Brixt traveled by foot after being refused an animal
-Brixt finally convinces Princess to let her take an animal
-Brixt eventually takes her own animal, which
--is killed by the storm
--is somehow sent home
--is bartered to the caravan people 

-Brixt followed Sidren because
--she sensed (from the disagreeing information) that something magical was going on, and that was enough of a lead for her to try to find Ivearnoun
--she's been looking for an excuse to leave Jororun for a while, to seek Ivearnoun; helping Sidren is an excuse
--she just wants to help Sidren
--she doesn't trust Sidren, and wants to keep an eye on her to see what she's up to (this is more plausible if the nature of Ivearnoun's amnesia diminished Brixt's and/or Brixt's mother's knowledge of exactly whom they were looking for; Brixt might even suspect Sidren of being Ivearnoun).

* rough draft notes

Brixt gets to the caravan -after Sidren because...
--Brixt makes the same journey as Sidren, but after, so it's actually harder (she has to go farther)
--Brixt makes the same journey as Sidren, but on an animal, which is smarter       
--both; Brixt makes the same journey, and she is able to do so in a more prepared manner (in terms of riding an animal or taking provisions), but she starts off too late, and is still out when the storm starts. She just barely makes it into shelter, even sustaining some minor injuries.

What is the purpose of Brixt? She must be a foil to Sidren in some way(s).
Sidren is somewhat logical, but also impulsive. There are a few people she idolizes, but she tends to feel superior to her peers and parents. She lies for a variety of reasons.
Brixt is emotional, but also careful and deliberative. She respects most people, but cultivates a strong dislike for a few. She greatly looks up to her mother and wants to please her. She never lies in the novel, and philosophically takes a hard line against deceipt.




Can you tell me where trees are?
Trees are in the ground. They grow like any other plant, like any bush or grass. But not in Jororun. The ground is not right. The height of the sun is not right.
So where are trees?
They are everywhere, if you go far enough. There are even trees in the fullness of Day, or so I've heard.
(Dismayed) But where can I find trees? If I were to walk to them, alone, where would I go?
I would not walk to them alone. But if I had friends, or a caravan, I would go Orth. Follow the river that brings us driftwood, and see where it brings it from. Some of the caravaners told me this morning that there is a forst up Orth. It has been so long since we've had a caravan FROM the Orth, heading South, that I cannot confirm. But the driftwood...


Trees are everywhere. They grow in the ground. But not here. The ground is not right here. The height of the sun is not right.
Where are trees, then? If you wanted to find trees, where would you go?
Orth. By [CITY], there is a forest - a great many trees.


At one point she says, "He is very dear to you?", and Sidren shows her the bangle (the first time in the story that she's mentioned it to anyone), and says, "He gave this to me."

At this point, Sidren has to become aware of the following things, in order:
1. Ydgar probably went [dir]
2. The caravan is going [dir]

* notes
** Sidren, Brixt, and Ydgar - themes and abilities

The three main themes of the novel are memory, honesty, and perception.
Sidren has the best memory, in the sense that only she remembers Ydgar.
Brixt has the best honesty, in that she's the only major character who never lies.
Ydgar has the best perception, in that he found a way - albeit roundabout - to defeat the statues, and perform other somewhat miraculous acts.

** Sidren's thoughts re: magic etc

When Sidren walks out of the Fort, she thinks that...
+ The bangle is magic and is the reason she didn't forget Ydgar
+ She has not forgotten anything.
+ She is not confident that pulling Ydgar out of the Fort will solve anything; she suspects that Ydgar - and now herself - are contaminated. Or, she thinks that maybe everyone EXCEPT Ydgar are tainted, since he's the only one who (presumably) never forgot himself.
+ Has built up a false idea of how magic works.

** Sond
*** compass

 N
S O
 D

"South and Orth, Night and Day"
Suggests a permanent dusk.

*** nomenclature

Inhabitants are known as Sondar.

*** cultural, daily-life (worldwide)

There are two kinds of shadows: those which move, and those which do not.

Lots of naps; not many long sleeps.

Roughly speaking, if you can see the whole sun, it's too hot (~100 F); if you can see none of the sun, it's too cold (~32 F).

*** animals

Possibly more bats than birds

Likewise, more moths than butterflies

In general, lots of cave-like life near the coler zones. Large insects, bugs with long antennae. Raccoons, rats, bears, and wolves.

Crepuscular: active during twilight and dawn.
Vespertine: active during twilight.
Matutinal: active during dawn.

Crepuscular animals, from Wikipedia:
+ some bats, hamsters, housecats, stray dogs, rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, rats
+ jaguars, ocelots, strepsirrhines, red pandas, bears, deer, moose, chinchillas, mice, skunks, Australian wombats, wallabies, quolls, possums and marsupial gliders, spotted hyenas, bobcats, tenrecidae, capybaras, African wild dogs, sitatunga, and the extinct Tasmanian tiger
+ nighthawk, owlet-nightjar, chimney swift, American woodcock, and spotted crake
+ many moths, beetles, flies, and other insects
+ lemurs?

"Cathemerality, sometimes called metaturnality, is the behaviour whereby an organism has sporadic and random intervals of activity during the day or night..."

*** plant-life

Lots of mushrooms, especially just into the cold areas, and in the permashadows.

Trees exist, but fight for light; might end up being very tall, or arranging themselves over time into lines. Maybe lots of saplings, but as they grow old, many die. Trees have permanent shadows; plantlife there becomes moist mushroomy or just dies.

*** warfare and subterfuge

As in most activities, it is preferable to fight with your back to the sun. However, if trying to evade someone, it is often preferable to be Nightward of them, so that your shadow doesn't touch them.

*** science

Sond probably orbits a red giant.

Theoretically, the following things out to be precisely related:
+ The size of the planet
+ The size of the sun
+ The distance between the planet and the sun
+ The bending of the sun's rays in the atmosphere
+ Pole temperatures
+ The exact placement of the sun, visually, in the sky
+ The power of the engines keeping the habitable zone habitable
+ The length of shadow of any object of definite height

** deception

Times when it might be okay to lie:

A “White lie” that is very minor and non-mallicious, and simply for the sake of convenience (for instance, giving someone a not-quite-accurate description of your work, because you think it wouldn’t be interesting to them to really go into proper detail)

An insincere compliment

Nazis-at-the-door situation

Magically (or casually) deceiving yourself

Feinting in combat

Feinting in sport

Lying in a pre-established game

Lying as a way to entertain (especially kids)

Lying to pacify / gain cooperation (especially the mentally infirm)

Lying to comfort

Lying because you have formally agreed to

After thirteen years of blood, Tercrest cried out for water. So Triskel, unrested in so many fields, lay down and slept in the doorway of the the house of Immalauth. He dreamed then of a journey back to his homeland, and of unmolested passage through the mountains of Kern, and of a poliquin lined with gold. He dreamed of an audience with ten thousand of the citizens of Rithigar. He dreamed of his father's house, and his father's measured words. He dreamed of the forest when the trees grow close and dry.



After three months of blood, the people desired water. Therefore Triskel fell down and slept upon the field of honor in the place where Immalauth walked, and he dreamt of a journey back to his homeland, and of a passage through the mountains of Kern, and of a casket lined with gold. He dreamt of an audience with ten thousand of the citizens of Tercrest, and of his father's house, and of the forest when the trees grow old and dry.

** magic 01

Ivearnoun's auto-amnesia either is:
    -Deliberate
        She'd only do this if it was clearly necessary, e.g. if the enemy has some ability to read minds.
    -Foreseen but unavoidable
        She'd only do this if it was clearly necessary, e.g. if she absolutely had to be in a certain place or forget something else, which ended up making her also forget herself
    -Unforeseen
        Would have to be, again, in the process of some sort of movement or forgetting for this to take place even accidentally

When you fall asleep outside the Fort, you forget everything which is currently physically inside the Fort.
When you fall asleep inside the Fort, you forget everything which is currently physically outside the Fort.

The effect is continuous. People DID keep remembering the Blue Boy, but generally not long enough for it to matter.

So how would one forget oneself?
What special rule might apply to make an external thing be internal?

When you forget a physical entity because of separating by the Fort, you forget the entity itself, and it's also pulled out of any memories, to be replaced by confabulation. These memories are all "waiting" to be restored, but require a catalyst. The catalyst must be:
    -Another physical object, un-separated from the subject, which is strongly memory-linked to the forgotten entity. E.g., the bangle.

Could Ivearnoun have forgotten because she left part of herself in the Fort? She could be a cripple; leave an eye or something in there. Or just her blood. I guess the whole thing wouldn't have to be 100% hard.

But why would seeing Ydgar remind her? Even if he's strongly memory-linked to herself, surely a million things would be.
Or maybe not... maybe she went to Tercrest, a place with no connection to Ivearnoun at all; so there was nothing to remind her of who she was.

But then EVERYONE would forget Ivearnoun.... hmmm





Ivearnoun hid in the fort a cache of everything she had (more or less) that associated her with Ivearnoun; every magical accoutrement, artifact, and souvenir. Note that for this to work, Ivearnoun must NOT be her given name; it has to be associated with her magical training/career/whatever. However, Temperance also does not have to be her given name; rather, suppose that in real life, she had the name X, and took the name Ivearnoun for various reasons; and in the process of subjecting herself to the amnesia, she set herself up with Temperance as a false name; so, once the amnesia fell upon her, if her mind found a memory that wanted a false name and tried to supply one, it readily came up with "Temperance".

There still has to be a good reason for Ivearnoun to do this in the first place, and a good reason for Ydgar to be a key capable of jogging her memory. But note that I can use this whole thing to support the idea that magic is a meta-discipline, and you don't get good at it in the same way that you strengthen a muscle, even a mental muscle; you get cleverer at arranging your life such that magic works for you (not unlike having a strong will vs. exercising avoidance of the near occasion of sin). I also want to promote some variation on the idea that magic requires not thinking about, or not looking at, or not interacting with, the thing you are making or doing or creating or whatever, and that there are no shortcuts here; the most powerful magic frays if you (the caster) think directly about it, and not-thinking-about-something is just as impossible to learn, as a skill, for a magician as it is for a nonmagician. Ivearnoun's prowess, cleverness, effectiveness, is that she had both the creativity and boldness to leverage the fort to force her to forget her spell.

Actually, that might be the best explanation for why she inflicted herself with amnesia in the first place: to support some spell which would fall apart if she so much as thought about it. This would then explain nicely why her own timer starts once she remembers herself, why she must depart and with haste (not to mention retrieving her accouterments).

Anyway, it'd be great if I could connect this particular case of creating/maintaining a spell through nonthought with my as-yet-kinda-vague notion of how spells of uncertainty (e.g., the healing spell used on Ydgar) are made. Not sure the exact connection, but I feel like it's there.

From a practical standpoint, creating a magical spell looks like going through the motions, packaging up the "act", transporting it, and unpacking it later on. Package a sword swing, sell it to someone, they open the package, the sword swings. Done. But what is actually happening is that when the creator of the spell does the thing, they're opening up one end of a time-and-space-travel line, whose other end is anchored somewhere else, later (but simultaneously, from the perspective of, say, the sword). In a very real way, the act is already completed, really completed, inbetween the time of its creation and the time of its activation. The key is in ignorance: the power of the spell relies on the capabilities of the caster, and in the uncertainty that follows its creation. This will not really work from a strictly materialistic point of view, but... in essence, anything is possible for a particular magical Act so long as A. it was within the capability of the caster and B. no paradox is/can be created for its use. So, if Adam makes a spell and gives it to Bill who uses it on Charles, then Adam will know—and will have known—exactly the effect of that spell. But if Adam makes a spell and gives it to Bill, and then tells Bill and Charles what it does, and Charles avoids Bill in fear, then EITHER Charles will fail to avoid Bill, OR he succeeds, and the spell is destined to discharge elsewhere and elsewhen.

Note that Acts are interactional, relative, not absolute. You don't (normally) package up forces, but interactions. So for the sword swing, you could (I suppose) package up the interaction between your hand and a future sword, but more likely, or more powerful, to package up the activity of swordfighting someone. So for instance, a master swordsman initiates the process of creating a spell, and suddenly finds that he is, in a strange and magical but real way, fighting a brigand with black hair; he defeats and kills the brigand, the spell is complete, and he gives it to someone else, but says only that it is a spell of fighting someone. Now, the buyer can use—or attempt to use—the spell on, say, a brigand with red hair, and it may work, and then the caster will have always known it was red hair. But if the caster had initially TOLD the buyer it was a brigand with black hair, then it would work on no other brigand.

This makes things complicated, but interesting. Of note: spells can probably never be guaranteed to work; if the buyer tried to use the spell on someone the caster was unwilling to slay, like a child, then it definitely wouldn't work; it's possible that the buyer would be killed, and the spell would *necessarily* stick around in some form but eventually discharge against a black-haired brigand. The caster could explain the details of the spell to a third party without incident, so long as the third party did not disclose the details to the user (of course, they COULD tell them, but as soon as anyone knows the details of the spell, they are unable to use the spell on anything other than those details. This is, from the perspective of everyone knowledgeable about the spell, weird; for instance, the caster can honestly tell the buyer that the spell will work on any swordfighter, and be speaking the truth, while simultaneously knowing for a fact that the spell can only work on a black-haired brigand. This disconnect between one subjective reality and another has to do with probability...).

Paradoxes simply cannot occur. First of all, it's hard to get any information back through a spell, because then it will just end up fitting that information. You can't, say, create a spell to "see what happens to person X in three years"; you can only create a spell to "witness whatever happens to [blank] at [blank time]". You won't know the what and the when until you're casting the spell, and you might not recognize them even then (note that if you DO create a spell that does nothing other than witness, then you probably don't care about discharging that spell, because it will inevitably discharge itself at the appropriate time. Although you could use that... whatever.).

It is also possible, as a literary failsafe, for a spell to just refuse to form, if there is no future event that would make a non-paradoxical total scenario. Ultimately, the act of creating a spell, an Act, is to (by some means) look or search through or otherwise open yourself up to the nearly infinite future, until you find something which accords with the INTENTION BEHIND YOUR SPELL, and then doing whatever is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the spell. So for instance, the spell that saves Ydgar implies that... there was someone who was really good at healing, healing anyone of any hurt, and the started the spell process, with the following intention: "as soon as I find anyone, injured in any way, I will heal them". They then find Ydgar, and heal them.

BECAUSE OF THEIR HONEST INTENTION, and BECAUSE OF THE IGNORANCE OF EVERYONE ELSE, the spell now works on ANY injury on ANY person. If the healer had the same intention but, after creating the spell, told everyone exactly what they'd done, then the spell would only ever work on Ydgar, and only ever with those exact wounds. Likewise, if the healer had had the intention "as soon as I find anyone with major wounds, I will heal them", then the spell would ONLY work on someone with major wounds, EVEN IF THE BUYER WAS IGNORANT OF THIS FACT. Likewise, the spell would not work at all if the healer had no skill at healing, again regardless of the knowledge or ignorance of the buyer.

This means that intention and follow-through are incredibly important, as are the trustworthiness of the spellcaster.

This is also where the stable-time-loop stuff comes in. For instance: Carl asks Bob to make him a spell of killing. Bob starts the spell process, searches for someone to kill, and kills an unknown man with orange hair. Gives the spell to Carl. Later, meets the man with orange hair, and decides he doesn't want him killed; if he then has the means to prevent Carl from ever using the spell on the orange haired man, then the spell, retroactively, will never have been about the orange haired man.

Or, uh... He stops Carl from using the spell on the orange-haired man; Carl uses it on a black-haired man. So no, retroactively, Bob made the spell with a black-haired man in mind; but then didn't stop Carl from using the spell on the orange-haired man. Either this resolves, ultimately, into a stable time loop, or the spell DOESN'T GET CREATED IN THIS WAY. If the spell only worked with the orange-haired man, then it wouldn't work at all.

So for instance, suppose you have a glass slipper which is totally unique. You decide to create a spell of drawing-a-picture-on-that-glass-slipper. You decide that, after creating the spell, you will smash the slipper before the spell can be used. One of the following must occur:
-The spell will refuse to come together in precisely the way you want (for instance, it might work, but with a different glass slipper)
-The spell will refuse to come together at all; there will be no spell
-The spell will work but Unlikely Events will occur, such as: someone unexpectedly preventing you from smashing the slipper; someone creating a slipper of exactly the same type; etc.
DECIDE IF ONE OF THESE IS MORE LIKELY THAN THE OTHERS.

Also, it is probably pretty hard to use big spells on small things... for instance, the healer in the previous example knows that they can heal any hurt in under five years. So to create their ultimate spell, they require five years. If they spend only three years, then everyone will know that they only spent three years, so no matter what they did, it cannot be five years worth of healing. For the spell to work on ANY ailment, the caster must be WILLING to spend five years twiddling their thumbs, in case the healing process turns out to be short and minor. Of course, if the caster sets aside five years, and the healing process only takes one, they cannot then do anything with those remaining four years and expect that spell to work for anyone else on a >1 year problem... meaning... something... this information stuff is hard.
-Maybe the spell always takes five years, but if it was an easy spell, the rest of that time is spent in limbo, or lost, or skipped?
-Or rather: caster spends five years in their shack, doing their thing. If the spell is used to treat a minor thing, it will then turn out that the caster had spend the remaining time doing other stuff. If the spell is used to treat a major thing, it will then turn out that the caster had no free time. This ONLY WORKS if the caster brought no significant information regarding their extracurricular activities to light before the discharging of the spell...
-Maybe the caster just amnesizes themself of the contents of the spell...?

Note also that I could do the standard convenient thing and say that... if you try to warn someone about the contents of a spell, or whatever, it frequently will turn out ironically to cause the effect... e.g... you say, "Don't worry, this killing-spell won't work on your brother because it will only work on a red-haired man!" and then the person's brother dyes their hair... Also, perhaps the information that the caster gets is vague, or limited. Maybe when the great Healer cast their spell of healing Ydgar, they knew only that a boy with certain injuries was there. Perhaps they knew only those things which they had the means and motive to affect: the person and their injuries. Perhaps no other information could pass through. hum

Can it be ever be KNOWN why a spell failed to form? Probably not, or else this would be a method of forming a paradox.

Is possible for a swordfighter to attempt to create a duel spell, only to die to his opponent ("now" according to his own timeline)? Suppose a healer tries to make a healing spell, but their patient dies. They can say nothing, and the spell (from the buyer's POV) will still work on applicable cases; but from the healer's POV, it might be reasonable for them to never sell such a spell, fearing retribution. But if the possibility space stretched to include all possible patients, then it might be impossible for them to make a spell at all. Of course this would also be the case, presumably, with a duel spell whose possibility space included any instance of failure.

(Spells probably attach to physical objects, as specks of light; touch to target to discharge. They probably do not display any information about their contents, although perhaps they display information about their age or origin; and perhaps they may be connected to a magical label, or a small spell whose only effect is to impart information.)

Perhaps casters do not see/remember details. Perhaps they remember nothing... or they remember the balance, the average, of probabilities. In either of these cases, perhaps if they are alive when the spell discharges, then suddenly remember it in full (they may even fail to discover the modification to their memory until they happen to remember the spell). 

(It'd be nice if, when a spell FAILS to be created, that failure conveys information to the reader, rather than just seeming like a free excuse.)

Stable time loops... suppose a swordfighter tries to create a dueling spell. The possibility space of the opponents that they meet will be limited to what that spell may be used on. But THAT possibility space will be limited by what the swordfighter remembers of the creation of the spell, and back and forth. Loop, correct?

OK. I don't want the information to all catch up with you at once, like in Looper, that's dumb. But you must "remember" what you do in SOME aspect, or else it's not an "interaction". And it makes no sense for the body to "remember" but the mind not. And I could veil things with some convenient mental fog, which only lifts at the correct time... bah.

A duelist decides to create a dueling spell. He somehow enters the possibility-space.
    He remembers every detail of an exact exchange; he may even be killed by his opponent. Call this DEFERRED MOMENT MAGIC
        When the spell discharges, his memory will not change, but be confirmed.
        If the spell fails to form, it's either because the possibility space he was aiming at is actually 0 (unlikely), or that no stable time loop was possible.
    He remembers only the average. Call this AVERAGE POSSIBILITY MAGIC
        When the spell discharges, his memory will not change.
        If the spell fails to form, it's because the possibility space he was aiming at is actually 0 (unlikely).

What is the possibility space? How is it entered, refined, aimed at? Maybe...
    -The possibility space is all of the future; a duelist may end up facing a child, or even a fern. This is bad because the caster would tend to end up facing, from their own perspective, spells that couldn't be sold. Of course, they could be sold for far-future usage... but eh.
    -The caster refines their search results somehow. Either they're interacting with a divine intelligence, or the universe itself comprehends search queries... or perhaps they "bounce" instantaneously out of the possibility space every time they wind up somewhere inapplicable. But if they have some conscious control over where they're going, then they would be able to just wait until their perfect, ideal opportunity arises; it makes the desire of the caster VERY important in your choice of buying and using spells... if you wanted a good spell, you'd have to get a caster who was ACTUALLY WILLING to use their power on the first applicable thing that came by in possibility space, or else that spell will only work on what the caster considers to be a good target.
        -If the caster decides they want to, say, kill their brother, and they enter the possibility space looking for some future version of their brother to kill, then maybe that request is so specific that it's hard to actually find their brother... or maybe they find them 30 years in the future, and if they kill them then, then (in their personal timeline), it guarantees the life of their brother for 30 years (which then invokes time loop and paradox stuff).

Healer creates a one-year healing spell. Options:
    1. Healer disappears, reappears, instantly. When discharged, the healer appears and sticks around for a year.
        VERY EASY to make paradoxes (e.g., kill healer while healing).
    2. Healer disappears, reappears after a year. When discharged, the healer appears and sticks around for a year.
        JUST AS EASY to make paradoxes.
    3. Patient disappears from future, appears in past for a year, then reappears at the same moment in future. E.g., patient is allowed/forced to travel backwards, then forwards, in time.
    4. Patient disappears from future, appears in past for a year, then reappears in the future, a year after their departure.
        Easy to indefinitely remove people as obstacles by creating a spell which only confines them?

If DEFERRED MOMENT MAGIC, 3 is best option so far, makes most sense with Ydgar. Though I don't know if I care for the literal time travel.
    3a. The performance of the spell takes a full year of regular time for the caster. They might leave their cottage (or whatever) and go to town and say "Oh yes, I'm casting a spell right now." and then go back. They might share details, friends might even be able to WATCH them, but of course the more information gets out about the spell, the less useful it is. A spell of heal-anything-that-can-be-healed is much more marketable than a spell of heal-a-brown-haired-boy-of-seven-from-his-three-snakebites.
        SIDE EFFECT: You might be creating spells without knowing it. oooo spooooky
    3b. The performance of the spell takes a full year of subjective time for the caster (and their spell-affected environment), but when the spell is complete, they'll find that no time has passed outside.
        LOOPHOLE: Easy way to artificially age things...

If AVERAGE POSSIBILITY MAGIC,
    1 and 2 can work paradoxless by accepting the disconnect between an average memory and a specific future interaction. It would mean that the spell could be discharged during the caster's lifetime, possibly even on them, thus temporarily duplicating them. But this starts to look a lot like regular, complicated time travel.
    3 can work, but the caster will then not be able to leave their spell-location for the duration of the spell, probably. People could watch, and they'd see a blur; many patients and many casters, all interacting simultaneously. If someone tried to stick their hand in, they'd become part of the spell, with not-entirely-clear results. Although in this case, the whole surrounding area is arguably part of the spell, if there is interaction... for instance, in DMM 3a, the caster can leave their shack, go to town, buy some more supplies, go back... but for APM 3a, if they tried this, they would leave their shack at innumerable, overlapping moments, and everyone they interacted with would have innumerable, overlapping reactions, and it would just spread, and everything would become vague and possibility-space-ified, at least until that possibility collapsed... I would have to define physical limits to the spell-area: everything within was in average possibility space; everything without was in regular, definite space.

APM ultimately has a more traditional magic feel to it. You cast a healing spell, and the amount of, say, water it requires will be the average of all the possible amounts; and therefore fairly consistent. Also, you're pretty much guaranteed to encounter some possibilities of danger and some of safety; so you'll neither come out of the spell in perfect health nor in death; you will sacrifice a *portion* of your life.

The master duelist takes their sword, and decides they want to fight someone — a swordfighter — strong enough to challenge them. (3a = spell-time is in the past; 3b = spell-time is outside of time)

DMM 3a, no crowd: the spell will probably work; a master swordfighter will arrive, and an epic duel will commence.
DMM 3a, crowd: the spell will probably NOT work: because of how much information will necessarily be transmitted backwards, the possibility space (especially in the near future) is tightly limited; so the spell will have to search out farther in the future, and be more likely to fail; and if it succeeds, it may be wrong in some particulars (getting a gunfighter instead of a swordfighter), or it may get something from a distant place and time which is bizarre to the caster.

DMM 3b, no crowd: the spell will probably work; the duelist disappears, and reappears, having fought an epic duel.
DMM 3b, crowd: the spell will probably work; the duelist disappears, and reappears, having fought an epic duel.

APM 3a, no crowd: the spell will probably work; you will fight many vague battles at once.
APM 3a, crowd: the spell will probably work; the crowd will see a vague impression of many battles at once.

APM 3b, no crowd: the spell will probably work; you will fight many vague battles at once, and return instantly.
APM 3b, crowd: the spell will probably work; you will fight many vague battles at once, and return instantly.

STUFF TO NOTE
    -The method that enables the best stories is superior (for my purposes) than the one which is the most inherently interesting.
    -DMM is going to be loopy and paradoxy, no matter how I cut it.
    -3b is definitely less interesting, I think.

REFININING THE ABOVE
    DMM 3a, no crowd: the spell will probably work; a master swordfighter will arrive, and an epic duel will commence.
    DMM 3a, crowd: the spell will probably NOT work: because of how much information will necessarily be transmitted backwards, the possibility space (especially in the near future) is tightly limited; so the spell will have to search out farther in the future, and be more likely to fail; and if it succeeds, it may be wrong in some particulars (getting a gunfighter instead of a swordfighter), or it may get something from a distant place and time which is bizarre to the caster.
    APM 3a, no crowd: the spell will probably work; you will fight many vague battles at once.
    APM 3a, crowd: the spell will probably work; the crowd will see a vague impression of many battles at once.

Note, suppose APM... and suppose the spell is interrupted 1/2 through. That information could be carried forward, so when the target of the spell experiences it, talks with the caster, could say, "we're going to be interrupted 1/2 through", which would then affect the caster. So the caster starts the spell, and in many of the probabilistic iterations, the target says "we're going to be interrupted 1/2 through". Caster could then change his schedule to 1/4 or the original, stopping before the scheduled interruption... unless the caster, at the initiation of the spell, sets the amount of time, and it cannot be changed from within, and maybe not even from without, either.

Or, maybe if a spell is interrupted, and everyone KNOWS it's interrupted, then it just won't be used for a long, long time... not until someone unaware of its nature uses it.

Of course, if all it takes to use a spell is a touch...

For APM, if I want to avoid the vagueness effect spreading, the duration of the spell CANNOT be internally defined. It has to be either pre-set by the caster, or interrupted by outside forces, or both.

...further notes...
On the casting of spells, the searching of targets. It can’t just be a random search through future events, or a lot of those would be, like, the insides of suns or whatever. Even if it’s just a search through future people, too many would be unacceptable targets. There has to be some sort of guidance by the caster, through intention and/or probability collapsing.

(What is the motivation for casters, other than selling their completed spells?)
(What about spells that go backwards?)
(Is HPMOR's prime number thing applicable?)

** magic 02 (trim)

Could you close your eyes, plug your ears, start a spell, swing a hammer, feel it connect, end the spell, have an almost-generic force-spell? If so, if you can package up force that has nothing to do with minds, that raises a great deal of possibilities:
    -Send a message to the future by targeting a blank piece of paper and writing on it.
    -Make a great hammer or such, make a bunch of spells targeting a wide variety of substances, hit them all with the hammer. Attach each spell to separate grain of sand. Toss a grain at any target to smash it. Or put them all on the end of a stick, so if you touch the stick to something, at least one of the spells will discharge.

Wouldn’t the easiest killing-spell just be... get a furnace, start a spell within the furnace targeting any flammable thing, wait a bit while it burns up, then end the spell? Instant burnt-up spell.

Could you make a spell within a spell?
P1 starts S1, targets P2. P2 is pulled from future to S1, in P1’s time. In S1, P2 starts S2, targeting P3. P3 is pulled from P1’s future (but might be P2’s past) to S2, in S1, in P1’s time.


1     T—————————————————————————————————————————————————
       S1(——)                    S1^
 
1.1   T—————————————————————————————————————————————————
       S1(—S2[——]—)              S1^        S2^

1.1.1 T————————————————————————————————————————————————— Impossible.
       S1(—S2[——*—)              S1^*——]     S2^

1.2   T—————————————————————————————————————————————————
       S1(—S2[——]—)     S2^      S1^

1.2.1 T————————————————————————————————————————————————— Impossible.
       S1(—S2[——*—)     S2^      S1^*——]

In 1.2, you can cast on a past entity, but only by coordinating with an even-more-past entity.

1.1.1 and 1.2.1 are impossible because S2 collapses when S1 (which contains it) collapses. Also because if it were not so, it would be far too easy an exploit to affect the past.

Similarly, a spell will collapse before it overlaps its own time period. E.g., you pull someone from future point X, and the probability of the spell collapsing approaches 1 as the current time approaches X. This is, again, both because it makes sense, and because otherwise it’s too exploitable.

Perhaps there is a certain substance which, by convention, is never an acceptable target for a spell; so that that substance can be used to physically contain spells, without discharging them. 

RULE: You do not know (for certain) the duration of a spell when you start to cast it.
RULE: The only person a spell cannot under any circumstances discharge against is the person who cast it.
THE HARDER I CAN MAKE THESE RULES, THE BETTER

In PRINCIPLE you can target anything, including inanimate objects; in principle you can make all sorts of small, force spells; arrow-stopping spells, rock-moving spells, etc. But in practise, only sentient beings are easy to find in the magical ether (through which one must search, in the process of casting a spell). Otherwise it becomes too easy and convenient to use magic to send messages, express force, etc. It’s easier for the instigator of a spell to find a target that is similar to themself; man to man, child to child, etc. But a very good spellcaster could indeed target inanimate objects.

It is very difficult, probably impossible, to target a particular individual with a spell; you can only target by various attributes. The “sweet spot” is to target those individuals who are similar to you, but to accept any of those individuals. Targeting is also guided by the interactional state of the target; for instance, a fighter will tend to find people ready to fight, and a healer, people in need of healing. This aids in spells actually being useful, but tends to prohibit finding particular individuals. In fact, one might say that it is almost a rule - maybe it IS a rule - that when you cast a spell, you will not recognize the one you meet. This would mean that contemporary spells would work much better in foreign countries, and increase the value of spells with the distance (spatial and temporal) from their creation.

The method for creating a spell doesn’t have to be full developed, but looks something like this: you define a space, choose a desired interaction, then (vague) open a portal and search for an entity that fits the other half of your interaction). If you succeed in finding such an entity and completing the portal, that entity will find themselves torn from their time and place and present with you. At this point you are not actually required to perform the “agreed” interaction; anything is possible. The spell collapses, and the entity is transported back to the time and place of their departure, when one of the following occurs: you or the entity leaves the space of the spell, or the local time (which keeps moving as normal) overlaps the time the entity came from.

When looking through the walls of an in-progress spell, either in or out, you see... things. Maybe possibilities. Maybe detail-less movements.

When you are the entity targeted by the spell, although you are transported from one time and place to another, your mind will tend to look over the incongruity. Very much like dreams, it will tend not to strike you as out of the ordinary. When you come out of the spell, it will be very much like coming out of a dream.

To outside observers, watching someone be targeted and affected by a spell, it will be a sudden change, and it will look like... what? A haze? A flash of light? Fire? Smoke? Smoke is incomplete combustion; maybe smoke is also incomplete spellcasting... what is spellcasting to combustion? 

Generally spells are successful, since people wouldn’t sell an unsuccessful spell. Although the danger of retribution is less, if spells are usually used far away from their conception... Spells made by duelists etc would be more reliable, because if the duelist had failed, they probably would’ve been killed, and thus never sold their spell in the first place.

    -The possibility space is all of the future; a duelist may end up facing a child, or even a fern. This is bad because the caster would tend to end up facing, from their own perspective, spells that couldn't be sold. Of course, they could be sold for far-future usage... but eh.
    -The caster refines their search results somehow. Either they're interacting with a divine intelligence, or the universe itself comprehends search queries... or perhaps they "bounce" instantaneously out of the possibility space every time they wind up somewhere inapplicable. But if they have some conscious control over where they're going, then they would be able to just wait until their perfect, ideal opportunity arises; it makes the desire of the caster VERY important in your choice of buying and using spells... if you wanted a good spell, you'd have to get a caster who was ACTUALLY WILLING to use their power on the first applicable thing that came by in possibility space, or else that spell will only work on what the caster considers to be a good target.
        -If the caster decides they want to, say, kill their brother, and they enter the possibility space looking for some future version of their brother to kill, then maybe that request is so specific that it's hard to actually find their brother... or maybe they find them 30 years in the future, and if they kill them then, then (in their personal timeline), it guarantees the life of their brother for 30 years (which then invokes time loop and paradox stuff).

Healer creates a one-year healing spell. Options:
    1. Healer disappears, reappears, instantly. When discharged, the healer appears and sticks around for a year.
        VERY EASY to make paradoxes (e.g., kill healer while healing).
    2. Healer disappears, reappears after a year. When discharged, the healer appears and sticks around for a year.
        JUST AS EASY to make paradoxes.
    3. Patient disappears from future, appears in past for a year, then reappears at the same moment in future. E.g., patient is allowed/forced to travel backwards, then forwards, in time.
    4. Patient disappears from future, appears in past for a year, then reappears in the future, a year after their departure.
        Easy to indefinitely remove people as obstacles by creating a spell which only confines them?

If DEFERRED MOMENT MAGIC, 3 is best option so far, makes most sense with Ydgar. Though I don't know if I care for the literal time travel.
    3a. The performance of the spell takes a full year of regular time for the caster. They might leave their cottage (or whatever) and go to town and say "Oh yes, I'm casting a spell right now." and then go back. They might share details, friends might even be able to WATCH them, but of course the more information gets out about the spell, the less useful it is. A spell of heal-anything-that-can-be-healed is much more marketable than a spell of heal-a-brown-haired-boy-of-seven-from-his-three-snakebites.
        SIDE EFFECT: You might be creating spells without knowing it. oooo spooooky
    3b. The performance of the spell takes a full year of subjective time for the caster (and their spell-affected environment), but when the spell is complete, they'll find that no time has passed outside.
        LOOPHOLE: Easy way to artificially age things...

If AVERAGE POSSIBILITY MAGIC,
    1 and 2 can work paradoxless by accepting the disconnect between an average memory and a specific future interaction. It would mean that the spell could be discharged during the caster's lifetime, possibly even on them, thus temporarily duplicating them. But this starts to look a lot like regular, complicated time travel.
    3 can work, but the caster will then not be able to leave their spell-location for the duration of the spell, probably. People could watch, and they'd see a blur; many patients and many casters, all interacting simultaneously. If someone tried to stick their hand in, they'd become part of the spell, with not-entirely-clear results. Although in this case, the whole surrounding area is arguably part of the spell, if there is interaction... for instance, in DMM 3a, the caster can leave their shack, go to town, buy some more supplies, go back... but for APM 3a, if they tried this, they would leave their shack at innumerable, overlapping moments, and everyone they interacted with would have innumerable, overlapping reactions, and it would just spread, and everything would become vague and possibility-space-ified, at least until that possibility collapsed... I would have to define physical limits to the spell-area: everything within was in average possibility space; everything without was in regular, definite space.

APM ultimately has a more traditional magic feel to it. You cast a healing spell, and the amount of, say, water it requires will be the average of all the possible amounts; and therefore fairly consistent. Also, you're pretty much guaranteed to encounter some possibilities of danger and some of safety; so you'll neither come out of the spell in perfect health nor in death; you will sacrifice a *portion* of your life.

The master duelist takes their sword, and decides they want to fight someone — a swordfighter — strong enough to challenge them. (3a = spell-time is in the past; 3b = spell-time is outside of time)

DMM 3a, no crowd: the spell will probably work; a master swordfighter will arrive, and an epic duel will commence.
DMM 3a, crowd: the spell will probably NOT work: because of how much information will necessarily be transmitted backwards, the possibility space (especially in the near future) is tightly limited; so the spell will have to search out farther in the future, and be more likely to fail; and if it succeeds, it may be wrong in some particulars (getting a gunfighter instead of a swordfighter), or it may get something from a distant place and time which is bizarre to the caster.

DMM 3b, no crowd: the spell will probably work; the duelist disappears, and reappears, having fought an epic duel.
DMM 3b, crowd: the spell will probably work; the duelist disappears, and reappears, having fought an epic duel.

APM 3a, no crowd: the spell will probably work; you will fight many vague battles at once.
APM 3a, crowd: the spell will probably work; the crowd will see a vague impression of many battles at once.

APM 3b, no crowd: the spell will probably work; you will fight many vague battles at once, and return instantly.
APM 3b, crowd: the spell will probably work; you will fight many vague battles at once, and return instantly.

STUFF TO NOTE
    -The method that enables the best stories is superior (for my purposes) than the one which is the most inherently interesting.
    -DMM is going to be loopy and paradoxy, no matter how I cut it.
    -3b is definitely less interesting, I think.

REFININING THE ABOVE
    DMM 3a, no crowd: the spell will probably work; a master swordfighter will arrive, and an epic duel will commence.
    DMM 3a, crowd: the spell will probably NOT work: because of how much information will necessarily be transmitted backwards, the possibility space (especially in the near future) is tightly limited; so the spell will have to search out farther in the future, and be more likely to fail; and if it succeeds, it may be wrong in some particulars (getting a gunfighter instead of a swordfighter), or it may get something from a distant place and time which is bizarre to the caster.
    APM 3a, no crowd: the spell will probably work; you will fight many vague battles at once.
    APM 3a, crowd: the spell will probably work; the crowd will see a vague impression of many battles at once.

Note, suppose APM... and suppose the spell is interrupted 1/2 through. That information could be carried forward, so when the target of the spell experiences it, talks with the caster, could say, "we're going to be interrupted 1/2 through", which would then affect the caster. So the caster starts the spell, and in many of the probabilistic iterations, the target says "we're going to be interrupted 1/2 through". Caster could then change his schedule to 1/4 or the original, stopping before the scheduled interruption... unless the caster, at the initiation of the spell, sets the amount of time, and it cannot be changed from within, and maybe not even from without, either.

Or, maybe if a spell is interrupted, and everyone KNOWS it's interrupted, then it just won't be used for a long, long time... not until someone unaware of its nature uses it.

Of course, if all it takes to use a spell is a touch...

For APM, if I want to avoid the vagueness effect spreading, the duration of the spell CANNOT be internally defined. It has to be either pre-set by the caster, or interrupted by outside forces, or both.

...further notes...
On the casting of spells, the searching of targets. It can’t just be a random search through future events, or a lot of those would be, like, the insides of suns or whatever. Even if it’s just a search through future people, too many would be unacceptable targets. There has to be some sort of guidance by the caster, through intention and/or probability collapsing.

(What is the motivation for casters, other than selling their completed spells?)
(What about spells that go backwards?)
(Is HPMOR's prime number thing applicable?)




Acts are usually created inadvertently.

Is the future act of magic effectively instantaneous, from the point of observers?

** magic 03

About this, "A spell will discharge if it is possible for it to discharge." stuff.

How exactly does that work? How exactly do you differentiate between a paradox and a non-paradox, especially when the only definite thing being transferred is information? Consider:

Caster makes a spell and sells it to Buyer. Tells Buyer that in the spell, Caster killed {human}.
Buyer can now use this spell on any {human} that Caster could have killed, re: Caster's morality and ability.

Caster makes a spell and sells it to Buyer. Tells Buyer nothing.
Buyer can now use this spell on ... anything? Anything that Caster might have done? Yes; but will have no idea what the effect of the spell is, making it less than useful (although if the spell took a long time to perform, they'll know it can at least occupy someone for a while...?).

Caster makes a spell and sells it to Buyer. Tells Buyer that in the spell, Caster killed {red-haired man}.
Buyer can now use this spell on any {red-haired man} that Caster could have killed, re: Caster's morality and ability.

Caster makes a spell and sells it to Buyer. In the spell, killed a black-haired man. But lies to Buyer; says he killed a red-haired man.
Buyer's ability to use this spell rely on Caster's words and intentions.
    If Caster would've killed whoever he saw, and would've said "red-haired" regardless, then the spell will work on anyone, although Buyer does not know this.
    If Caster would only have killed black-haired men, then the spell will only work on black-haired men, though Buyer does not know this.
    If Caster would kill whoever he saw, but would lie about their hair color, then the spell will only work on non-red-haired people, though Buyer does not know this.

REGARDLESS OF WHAT CASTER SAYS, a spell to (eg) kill a person will only ever work on those people whom Caster was willing and able to kill at the time that they created the spell. Their words afterward do not change this. If they are HONEST (or reliably dishonest), then their words (if heard) CAN place further limitations on the spell, however. In short, a spell cannot activate and function in a way factually contrary to its conception and any information that comes out of its conception.


IMPORTANT!!
AGAIN. Looking at this, "A spell will discharge if it is possible for it to discharge." stuff.

Consider: Caster makes a spell and sells it to Buyer. Caster tells Buyer that it's a killing spell, and will only work on a black-haired man. Buyer then throws spell at pie ingredients. Strictly speaking, there's a CHANCE (however infinitesimal) that Caster actually suffered one or more bouts of madness/hallucination, and the spell in fact only has the effect of making pie ingredients into a pie.

Consider also: It must all be probability-based. If it CAN discharge it WILL... except that it ALWAYS can. It’s just more or less plausible.

The manner of the discharging of a spell cannot cause a change in the contents of that spell (although it can determine how the probability waveform collapses... acausal stuff.)

** magic 04 (rules)

It is possible to target an entity in the (relative) past, but only if you yourself are first targeted by a caster in the even-more-past.

A spell can never discharge against the entity which created it.

In planning on using spells in the future, their utility is probability-based.
In looked back at spells used in the past, their utility is deterministic and acausal.

Looking backwards, no spell will ever have failed to discharge when it could have done so (e.g., when it physically touched a target entity that was suitable according to the information known by the observer... wait how does that work). Looking forwards, a spell will only fail to discharge when it contacts an entity who turns out to be unsuitable for reasons which are (or should be) known.

The difficulty is that, you wouldn’t want a spell that just did *anything*. You want to strike a balance where you know what the intended effect of the spell is, and are reasonably confident that the caster was capable of performing that effect, but you also know as little as possible about the caster’s temperement, identity, etc. Likewise, one should make full use of the information they have about the spell’s contents and creator, but make no effort to learn too much more information.

How exactly one “searches” through magical possibility space, and the likeliness of finding a desirable target, must remain vague.

When a spell is begun, it encompasses a definite area, the edges of which can be sensed by vision or some other normal means.
A spell ends when one of the following occurs:
    The caster leaves the spell area.
    The target leaves the spell area.
    The caster’s timeline overlaps target moment.

Both caster and target experience the spell as a dreamlike state. Moreso the target; in particular, they often won’t realize that anything is odd about it until subsequent reflection. They will frequently think that the actions performed by the caster are actually performed by whoever put the spell on them.

During the creation of a spell, other people can enter the spell-area and interact with both the caster and the target without any particular effects. Only the appearance and disappearance of the target would arouse their attention.

Proposal: A spell will not work while the caster is still alive.

Spells can work when other people know what they do, so long as you yourself don’t, and the effect you intend to get out of it is not inconsistent with the behavior of the people who know what it does...

Maybe it’s impossible for a caster to lie about the contents of a spell?
Or... I might have to whitewash some of this by just saying that caster’s don’t remember the contents of spells. It’s just hard finding a way to reconcile how they find targets.

There is a method of discharging a spell at someone, but lacking this method, it also works if the spell phyiscally touches an applicable target.

** magic 05 (dangerous information)

Spells are initiated by someone in the past, targeted upon someone in the future.
It is possible to target the (relative) past, but only in the sense that you might be the target of an even-futher-past spell, and while that's going on, both the creation and discharge of a spell occur... unless the spell you create doesn't come with you when you snap back to your present. This would make sense.
...either that, or it's impossible to have a spell-within-a-spell. This would be to 1. avoid ontological paradoxes, and 2. create a situation where you might deduce your presence in a spell by inability to create a spell.

Spells may or may not be castable on non-sentient or non-specific targets.

Spells occupy time in the present, when they are cast. Their discharging occurs very quickly, maybe even instantaneously, to observers.

Spells end when
    The casting time would overlap the target time.
    Either the caster or the target becomes aware (that is, reasonably certain) that a spell is occurring.
        Or something more specific...
    Caster or target leaves spell area?

It is possible to target an entity in the (relative) past, but only if you yourself are first targeted by a caster in the even-more-past.

How is a spell initiated?
- Pattern of physical objects/matter
- Memetic pattern; spaces between objects, thoughts one's having?
- Temporal pattern; timings
- 

What is it that you have to recognize to break a spell? It should probably be something beyond "a spell is occurring", as that's too abstract a thing to realize, especially if you're not knowledgable about spells.
- The fact that a spell is occurring
- That the other party is the caster/target of a spell
- The physical or memetic pattern necessary for a spell (even if you don't know what a spell is)
-- Maybe it's a temporal pattern, but the easiest way to set it up is with a physical pre-made pattern... but then how does it actually start? How does the caster (inadvertently!) make it go? IF I ever describe this, it must be something that people could plausibly recognize from their own lives; but it must also be somewhat specific. Preferably, recreateable, for funsies.

There has to be a way to reliably, even somewhat reliably, use spells; it's too much for it all to be just take-my-word-for-it.
- Maybe you can't lie about a spell? But then you could deduce information by trying to lie about it.
- 

** magic 06 - absolute ignorance

A spell collapses the moment any person within it becomes aware that it is a spell.
?- Does this mean that the entire spell collapses, or that people come out of it, one-by-one, as they realize what's going on?
- Note for further stories: suggest that every experience in life is a kind of spell, and will end when its true nature is known. Death brings absolute and complete knowledge. Or, death constitutes true knowledge of mortality.

Spells are created, or creatable, when there is a significant change to a body of matter (a place) that has not had very much change in a long time. Notably: cataclysmic events, upheaval of the earth, etc.
- 


A spell is creatable when sudden and significant change occurs in a place where there has not been change in a long time.

It must be impossible not to notice, if you understand the theory.

Expectation (of finding a target) does not cause the spell to occur, but facilitates credulity, which is a prerequisite of the spell.

Phantom voices, etc, brief glimpses, are explained by spells which occur and collapse in single moments, due to the target immediately realizing that something is off.

...

If the trigger for the creation of a spell is the changing of a familiar location/situation... There should be a *specific thing* which, if noticed, breaks the spell. Can it be more specific than "this person is out of place"? Something with a sharper dividing line? A line which you *could not fail to notice* if you know what to look for and were looking for it? Maybe this is good enough.

So, basically, if you are *consciously aware* that someone is *"out of place"*, or equivalent, that breaks the spell.

** memories

Progression of Sidren’s knowledge of amnesia-magic
-Guipathorme tells or suggests to her that seeing the forgotten entity, or maybe them leaving the spell, will instantly break it; this is inaccurate, and causes Sidren to fret later on, as she thinks Ydgar is forever lost. Guipathorme also tells her, accurately, that it’s easier to perform such spells on yourself, though you often have to go to some lengths to prevent yourself from remembering... (unless your goal is to NEVER remember, but that’s a bit drastic).





The nature of forgetfulness
The nature of the Fort and of forgetfulness must be at a certain balance when Sidren rescues Ydgar. She must be uncertain about what she will and will not remember. Specifically, she must worry that she will forget Ydgar, and forget her whole past; she must have some suspicion that the bangle is magic. The decision to orate Part 1 to Ydgar must be motated partly by real fear that she will forget.

One of the rescued recommends to Sid that she write down her adventures in the Fort, which is how she is able to remember them and recall them to her mother (noting also that, with the conclusion of the story, her mother, too, will forget them).





When you hit REM while inside the fort, you lose knowledge of everything outside the fort.
When you hit REM while outside the fort, you lose knowledge of everything inside the fort.

“Everything” in this context refers to physical objects, including living beings. When you lose knowledge of something, you forget that it exists, and it is removed from all memories. When recalling one of these affected memories, your mind closes up the gaps, confabulates substitute details. For memories in which the object played a principle roll, this may lead to confusion, uncertainty, or forgetting the memory altogether.

Seeing (or otherwise sensing) the object will, usually, immediately restore knowledge of it, and affected memories will be repaired the next time they are recalled.

Seeing (or otherwise sensing) another object that is strongly related to the forgotten object has a strong chance of immediately restoring knowledge of the forgotten object.

Seeing (or otherwise sensing) information about the object, such as hearing its name or being reminded of a memory of it, usually will not restore knowledge of the object.

All these are strongly influenced by how strong the knowledge was in the first place. The very strongest knowledge can be restored more or less spontaneously.

The lost knowledge is not lost in precisely the same way as a memory forgotten through non-magical means. There are two main points to this. First, aside from the exceptions above, lose knowledge is resistant to being restored. Second, when it is restored, it is restored fully, with little to no doubt or lingering confusion (aside, again, from the exceptions above).





Must consolidate thaumaturgical amnesia with:
-Why no one remembers Ydgar, except Sidren via bangle
-Why Princess doesn't remember Blacksmith
-Why the Princess forgets the sword, and why this ends the spell
-Why everyone remembers Ydgar when they see him
-Why Sidren's mother never forgets her (conflict with other townspeople?)
-Why Sidren forgets the other prisoners, but remembers foreboding, and remembers all when she sees them
-How Ivearnoun effects her auto-amnesia

Ivearnoun is near-ish the fort, but she never went in. It was too drastic a measure. She may have initially gone near the fort to watch or guard or study it...

Whether as a recourse against mind-reading, or something else, Ivearnoun's decision to self-amnesia MUST be logical (preferably semi-inevitable).






Memories themselves are more difficult to sever than the connections between them (Because actually destroying a memory entails also severing every connection to it)

“A memory is like an island...”
“Memories are like people in the water, with joined hands...”
“Making someone forget is difficult, because you must sever all of the connections to the island.”
“Couldn’t you simply sink the island?”
“Doing so would always be more difficult, because it would require severing all of the connections, as well.”

Bad guy's magic acts by severing the connections
Tricky magic, and takes some time to "set"; given average power of the caster, and average memory-strength of the target, it can be counteracted...
...in the first 8-? seconds by merely meditating / whatever
...in the first 5-20 minutes by simply remembering the target
...in the same waking period (sleeping sets memories) by being reminded by anything external
...in the first ~week by being reminded by something strongly associated, e.g. visually
...in the first ~year, by actually seeing the forgotten entity

Multiply the power of each of these by the strength of the association between the forgetter and forgettee, with 1 being 

Once one connection is re-formed, the others are ready for reformation

The longer the time period between the forgetting and the remembering, the more striking the remembering will be, and the more likely the forgetter will perceive it as actual forgetfulness (as opposed to vague confusion)

** Jororun royalty

There is some spell that has to do with the light, which causes superlative eyesight amongst the royalty, especially one at a time (helped along by genetics).

The king/queen is whoever is the best at seeing oncoming storms; possibly simply who has the best eyes. The rest of the royal family de facto get the mental jobs; remembering things, organizing things, etc. 

** The Profound Acts

The Profound Acts include:

Killing (Beast)
Healing
...etc...

King
Beast
Merchant
Wanderer
Theurge


The Profound Acts are ancient, but have a weird history, and are occasionally cycled (e.g., one is used up, then a replacement is created). In particular, most believe that the Healing Act present in RtBB is the work of an ages-old woman who was an exceptionally talented physician and theurge. However, this Act was discharged, and later replaced with an Act of similar effect but very different character: the work of several very well-trained doctors and surgeons with state-of-the-art equipment, but no theurgic knowledge to speak of.

The Killing Act, too, was replaced; originally it was the work of some entity or entities who showed no discrimination or sympathy, and who vowed to kill whatever person(s) appeared to them. But this Act, too, was discharged, and replaced by an Act created by a skilled, but principled, assassin. The assassin wore modern armor, used a high-powered rifle, and refused to kill women or children.

The theory behind the Profound Acts was that, although there were many Acts that could kill or heal certain people, in certain circumstances, at certain times, the Profound Acts were ultimately versatile: they would work in any situation, on any person, so long as it was physically possible (e.g., the Profound Killing Act was supposed to work on any mortal, no matter how powerful; and the Profound Healing Act was supposed to save any mortal from death, no matter how greviously injured, so long as they were still technically alive. The original Profound Acts did in fact fulfil these expectations, more or less; but at various points, some of all of the Acts were discharged and replaced by lesser versions).

** "statues" (robots)

If a robot shows up and speaks, it will speak in the ancient tongue (i.e., the colonists' tongue), which is understandable at an instinctual level to the characters; it will have to be saying something logical, about immediate danger, or its own malfunctioning, or its own prime directive, or directions to a crash site, 

The reason the robots do not faultlessly protect the Sondar is because, due to genetic altering, the Sondar's DNA is not a 100% match for human DNA. This might be discovered when Sidren touches one with her bare hand or foot...

"YOU ARE NOT MY MASTER"

** Ivearnoun's plot

Ivearnoun did not know that the Fort's amnesia magic worked both ways. She had a compatriot, who was willing to stay in the Fort and, after a certain amount of time, come out with the mask and return it to her. Of course, with Ivearnoun gone, this compatriot soon forgot she existed, and began confabulating other reasons why the mask was important, and never left the Fort.

Ivearnoun hid the mask, or placed in, in accordance with some belief or maxim or habit that she acquired before becoming Ivearnoun. Something like hiding it under a vase, or under a flagstone, or between two torches. Something that Sidren (and/or Brixt) notices when they visit Temperance, and how they intuit the location and importance of the mask when they're in the Fort.

...

+ Ivearnoun forgets...
++ That she is Ivearnoun.
++ How exactly magic works?
++ That she had the Mending Act.

The name "Ivearnoun" is a mantle; Temperance earnes it, and is not the first to do so. She and the world do not forget *what* "Ivearnoun" is, but simply that Temperance=Ivearnoun.

Temperance sees Ydgar, who looks like Odgar. This causes her to remember that she is Ivearnoun. How?

You can only remember someone/something in the Fort if you see them or see something which is *strongly linked* to them. Like if it's the *primary visual memory* (meaning what, exactly?). So, has Ivearnoun seen Ydgar before?

(Note: Odgar rescued Temperance-as-Ivearnoun.)

Maybe the idea is, when you see something, you WILL remember the primary association of that thing, even if it's in the Fort? But NOT (necessarily) secondary assocations. So, Sidren remembers Ydgar when she sees the bangle, because the primary memory of the bangle is him; but the Princess doesn't remember Ydgar when she sees his house, because enough other people have lived in it that its primary memory is just "the place where guests of honor live".

I think it just needs to be a little fuzzier. You remember the thing in the Fort if you see something that is, subjectively, strongly linked in your memory with it. The reason that no one else consistently remembers Ydgar is that he didn't really leave any possessions that people associated with him. He took his blue tunic; only Sidren knew about the bangle; the statue's finger was kept in a clay jar; the house was impersonal and not strictly his; etc.

** Translation issues

Sidren knows moths instead of butterflies, and bats instead of birds. But does she say "bats" or does she say "birds"? The former is better for younger readers, while the latter is better for longterm trickery.

** Brixt

NAME(S)
Brixt
Sivalaph
Sirtsama

BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS
Brixt has her own history, and her own motivations, and is very much responsible for her own death. Sidren, however, feels guilty, especially with the realization that, if they had asked Temperance about the Blue Boy, Brixt probably would have lived.

Sidren initially lies to Brixt about her reason for leaving, but slowly reveals more truth.
Brixt is the first one (apart from Sidren) to acknowledge the Blue Boy’s existence (when she sees him).

Brixt is softer than Sidren (Vasquez). A sweet girl. Maybe a sort of anti-Ydgar.

Brixt must have her own yearning, her own unfinished business. She must provide vital elements of the Sidren/Brixt team, such that it's not immediately certain how Sidren will continue without her.

Brixt's mishap must have causes and effects; meaningful connections both forward and backward in the fabric of the story.

The mishap must probably result in her death; it must be such that Sidren/Ydgar, intended to return exactly to Brixt, are reasonably certain that they can avoid the same fate (though they may have to skirt it; perhaps literally, if the fate is a cliff or hole).

Remember that, Brixt's presence in the fort causes others to forget her. Sidren must employ some artifice to ensure that she does not. They may or may not later retrieve the corpse, and if so, this may or may not remove the necessity of the visual reminder.

At some point, Brixt should let drop the fact that her mother, Veladitou, gave up her birth name upon becoming an Entrusted.

...

Brixta has a different quest, and in some ways a more traditional one: she’s searching for the stolen Profound Act(s), and her first stop is the old man, Guipathorme, in the caravan. Guip is known to have had contact with Ivearnoun at some point in the past. 

The Entrusted of Reazon

** Temperance / Ivearnoun

NAME(S)
Temperance, Ivearnoun

BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS
One of the great magic-users answering to Urzyn.
As Temperance: A storyteller. Lots of knowledge, to satisfy both her curiosity, and her wondering that she knows so many different things. She thinks her knowledge derives from the many stories she's learned and half-forgotten.

Ivearnoun is being hunted because she possesses one of the Profound Thauma, or whatever; the perfect healing spell. Using this spell on Ydgar is what alerts Ivearnoun’s enemies to her presence.dd

only makes sense for Ivearnoun's amnesia to be connected to the fort

Ivearnoun has attained at least one L5, and is either a Gifted or a Prodigy.

...

NOTE: One of the following is true:
    -True names are NOT enough to bring back amnesia’d memories, and Temperance does not recognize the name “Ivearnoun”.
    -”Ivearnoun” was not her given name, but a name she acquired upon becoming an Entrusted.
    -”Ivearnoun” was not her given name, but the name she adopted when she impersonated the real Ivearnoun.
The thing is, “Ivearnoun” isn’t in the Fort, or else no one would remember her; 


Sidren forgets Ydgar because Ydgar is in the Fort.
The bangle causes Sidren to remember Ydgar because the bangle is a physical object whose primary memetic connection is to Ydgar.

Temperance forgets “Ivearnoun” because 
    or
Temperance forgets that Ivearnoun is her identity because she lacks any physical object whose primary memetic connection is between herself and “Ivearnoun”.

Temperance fails to remember “Ivearnoun” because she lacks any physical object whose primary memetic connection (in her own mind) is to Ivearnoun.

If X is in the Fort, you forget X. Memories that contain X are either forgotten or confabulated to be otherwise.
Temperance cannot forget herself. So she has to forget the set of memories, M, where she is Ivearnoun, and possibly the set of memories, I, where the “Ivearnoun” identity exists at all.

1 Temp was given “Ivy” when she joined the Entrusted.
2 Temp impersonated “Ivy”.
.1 Temp forgets the “Ivy” identity.
.2 Temp remembers the “Ivy” identity but forgets that it’s hers.

1.1 She has to ditch any and everything she received as part of that role. May have trouble remembering the Entrusted at all. 
1.2 
2.1 Difficult. She can’t ditch the real Ivy.

** Princess

One of the Princess' jobs is to memorize and recount histories (and such), especially in the euphemistic (but ultimately, more or less accurate) style.

** Guipathorme

A relatively average magic-user, a "Natural Philosopher", named for one of Urzyn’s agents. Very academic, as far as such things go. Fancies himself rather a teacher.

** Sidren's family

At least one of Sidren's siblings is infirm.
Sidren's father was a soldier and died protecting Jororun some years ago.
Sidren's mother is loving and overworked. Preoccupied. She dotes on Sidrens younger siblings.

BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS
One:Very preoccupied, maybe foreign. Forgives quickly, and leaves. Has junk to do.

Another: Slow and analytical, like me. Reasons things through. Is the one to suggest writing things down.

Another: Fiery and angry. Also has junk to do, but is not so preoccupied. Has some stuff to say to Sidren. Such as, "not her".

Near the end, Sidren asks all three of the rescued people for forgiveness. One of the guys gives it to her quickly, without much thought. The other guy mulls it over, and considers all her actions, and says he understands her, and he forgives her. The woman says, "I do not forgive you." Later, Sidren relates this to Ydgar. Ydgar says, "Some will not." or "Some are like that." or something. Finally, Sidren asks him, "Does Brixt forgive me?" And Ydgar must say something like, "Do I know?", very sadly. (Are there any pastors? How fares Christendom?)

** Urzyn / Reazon / RZN

Maybe not in the novel.

** Zwer

"The Old Philosopher"
keeps the statue's "tail" in a clay jar; constantly coiling and uncoiling; maybe; or just mentioned that part of it is in the jar; just mention (imply) that it's moving?

** storms

1) The big storm at the beginning is either very long or (less likely) there's not sufficient shelter in Jororun for the whole caravan (depends on animals).

If long, where do Sidren and Brixt spend their time? Cave system? Other side of the mountain? It's pointless to rush out of the storm only to hide for a week...

2) The first storm is of unpredictable length, but ends up being just 1-3 days. Later on, end of the story, is a similar storm, but much longer (2-8 weeks). Jororun is safe (ish) during a storm, but impossible to leave.

** Forgetful Fort

speculation as to the fort; speculation that there are many such places, but they're not found because they're small or remote; fort may have been made to take advantage of, or close off, the forgetful space; maybe the spaces usually make you forget immediately, but the fort's magic is that you only forget when you sleep.

Maybe the Fort is an active, not passive, spell; broken not by phyiscal objects in particular, but by sight in particular (just as most spells are weak to one of the senses).

** Tercrest

** the bangle

A rough stone or wood bangle, in the shape of a teardrop

No magical properties

Made of a type of stone/wood unusual to Sidren's locale

** the hatchet

The spell on it breaks when it enters the fort (or, technically, when it’s in the fort AND the Princess is sleeping). This is one of a variety of events just before and during the first Fort episode that foreshadows the tragedy of Brixt’s mishap.

When the sword becomes sharp again, Sidren muses why it might be so.
Does magic simply not work in the other place?
Or does it break enchantments?
Or does it drain their power?
Or was the Princess wrong, and it only works for the Princess?
Did the Princess lie?
Or has the sword become a different, non-magical sword?
Or has the sword's "mind" become confused, and it's unable to tell what the wielder wants?
Musing on the figurative minds of enchanted objects

The sword was made for the Princess by a friend or lover or family member or such, whom she no longer remembers, due to the forgetful place. Sidren meets this guy.

the sword stops working in the fort because it's set to check the princess' will, then check Sidren's will, but when the princess forgets the sword, that mental connection is broken

in discussing the sword, saying it has a mind, will, intelligence... describe metaphor without using that word. say like, the kingdom has a head, but it's not really a head... so the sword does not think, but it sort of does

What is Sidren's request? Her question or complaint?
    If it's, "Everyone has forgotten this Ydgar bloke", then the Princess should be the last time she's so forthright about it.
    If it's completely different, there should be some suspicion that the Princess would have known more if Sidren had been honest with her.
    is there something that can make people forget? (this should be asked of Zwer etc, instead?)
    checks Princess' knowledge because she's the one who memorizes everyone?
        wants to check with the person who would have been tasked with remembering Ydgar, and that turns out to be the Princess


CORE MORAL OF THE STORY
    Deception? Honesty? Memory? Fraternal love? Forgiveness? Things are not always as they seem? Logic?
    Sidren lies, and is lied to, and learns that it's not always clear whether deception is morally acceptable.
    Sidren learns of the fragility of memory, and its important role in who people are and what they do (especially true if she ends up saving the world post-novel)
    Sidren manages to save Ydgar, and he manages to save her, though they are not romantically involved.
    Sidren seeks, finally, forgiveness; maybe it's likewise the greatest gift she has to give?
    Sidren learns that logic is a good thing to rely on when information becomes fuzzy.
        Sidren learns that the world is complex, and things are not always as they seem, and the control of the flow and integrity of information makes one powerful, and carries with it moral responsibility.







    What does the protagonist learn in the crux?
        What is the crux? The cart ride? 
    Who (if anyone) is the antagonist, and what is it that he doesn't understand?
        Not Ivearnoun. Not anyone currently named. 




!    Sidren needs some credible reason to think that the bangle originated in the same place that Ydgar last headed towards. Best possibilities:

1. Sidren's first hints about the bangle are that it's made of "wood", which come from "trees". She knows that he was heading in the same direction as his last journey, so she goes where she hears trees are.

2. When talking with Zwer (or whoever), Zwer mentions that, for one reason or another, it's highly like that Ydgar carved the bangle himself (maybe he can tell that it was carved recently), or that it has not long been removed form the place of its growth.





What hints could Sidren have of Ydgar's whereabouts, which do not include anyone else knowing about Ydgar after the story begins?
There must be little enough evidence that she begins to doubt her own memories of Ydgar.
    -before he left, she heard him talking about his next quest
    -the bangle (wood) - but if it's its creator, they would remember Ydgar because of the bangle.. mute? gone? anonymous festival?
    -hears something about a place that makes people forget, or where forgotten people go, etc
        -deduces the existence of such a place
        -witnesses people confabulating

HINT: remembers that Ydgar said he was going to look for trees (and bring one back?)
HINT: at Ydgar's house, finds... scratchings? a map?
finds out the caravan is going in the direction of trees

UNDERSTANDING OF AMNESIA-MAGIC
Figures out that everyone's forgotten Ydgar

Decides the bangle is magic


Fully understands how the Fort works








The message of the book. Why does Sidren save Ydgar? It is out of goodness, but her motivation is also due to her not understanding something properly. Maybe she's jealous? She wants him to herself? Or she wants his glory? Or, she would save no one except the handsome boy she was infatuated with?

Perhaps it's that she doesn't care about her family, her mother. She's not even honest with her. Is that the relationship she has to fix? Maybe she has to fix her relationship with her mother, AND something wrong with the wide world. Possible parallels:

Saving Ydgar = fixing relationship with Brixt
Saving world = fixing relatinoship with mother

Deceipt was always a good theme, especially with the role of the Fort, Ivearnoun's self-deceipt, and Sidren's potential self-deceipt. Sidren certainly lied to Brixt, and her mother. Does she lie to Ydgar? To herself?

Lies:
    mother (where she's going)
    Brixt (what she's doing)
    herself/prisoners?

There's someone else with Sid from earlier. Maybe Brixt, maybe someone else; but Sid chooses to leave them in the Fort. As in, does not try very hard to save them. THIS IS PART OF THE CLIMAX. The revelation about who this is, what Sid's done, why she's done it. The aftermath, what she does to atone, comes in the Ending.








Elements to come together
    The big storm
    Metaphor-storytelling
    Magic/forgetfulness
    Fallout of Ivearnoun's revelation
    Ydgar's quest
    Brixt's quest
    Sidren's guilt re: lying to her mother

There should also be something for the reader to unravel at the end. Something DEFINITE. Maybe start with the identity of the second narrator.

** old draft

...
Next, Sidren recounts the moment (and the surrounding day) in which she realized that everyone else had forgotten Ydgar. It was the day the caravan came town. Like all the days when the caravan came to the town, everyone was very excited, and everyone was doing something. All the children liked the caravan because it meant new sights and stories and strangers, and all the adults needed the caravan to trade (Jororun produced only goat products (wool, meat, milk), and maybe a few wolf pelts or whatever, but almost nothing else. They needed to trade for everything else). As Sidren went with some of the other village children, they discussed what stories they would ask the storyteller for. Sidren is (slightly) miffed when no one else recognizes her suggestion of a story of the Blue Boy. They don't remember the Blue Boy, and think she's talking about the Blue Wanderer.

The storyteller lived where the statue was...




Sidren recounts the parade in Jororun, in the Big Valley, that met Ydgar following his defeat of the evil statue. He gave her the bangle. She sort of fell in love with him. The novel starts three years later, when one day, during the coming of a trading caravan, she realizes that no one remembers that there ever was such a person as Ydgar. At first she thinks it’s some sort of cruel joke, but then she realizes that people have genuinely forgotten. She tries to figure this out, by going to the older, wiser, or more honest members of her part of Jororun (”Small Valley”, “Southern Hill”, etc etc). Finally, out of desperation, or some sense of duty, she decides to go to (or take an opportunity to go to) the Big Valley, which is a journey (on foot) of somewhere between 4-8 hours. One or two of her siblings accompany her. She doesn’t know the people in the Big Valley quite as well, but she quickly ascertains that no one there remembers Ydgar, either. She manages to find his house, by (something like) asking people where they’d put up a boy who saved the city but had no family... maybe also by asking multiple people about the house, and realizing that they give different answers (but sincerely). There’s little in the house, but *some*thing that gives her a bit of a hint. She ultimately ends up at the royal cave, possibly after being arrested on suspicion of being a looter or something, or due to someone’s amnesia-fueled assumption (INEVITABILITY?). Regardless, at the cave, she takes the opportunity to meet with the Princess, and explain, insofar as she is able, her situation; make sure to previously establish SOMETHING that makes this more natural, for instance, invoking a duty of the Princess or some piece of the Princess’ history that Sidren knows, or something. Anyway, while talking with the Princess, Sidren determines that she has to consult with the caravan people or maybe join them; she also finds out that they’re already leaving, due to an oncoming storm. She knows she needs to barter with the caravan people, but has nothing of value, so in a moment of kindness, the Princess gives her her bronze (bronstone) hatchet. Sidren runs off, stopping to impart an untrue message to her sibling(s) regarding where and why she’s going. She runs off, and though it seems at first that she’s too late, she sees the caravan and manages to join it just in time.

Once on the caravan, Sidren’s situation is worse because she lied and she doesn’t know where she’s going; it drives forward because she wants to find out her information quickly so that she can get back home, or at least get to where she needs to go before the caravan takes her all over creation.

While on the caravan, Sidren talks to the people she thinks will know, or otherwise does the thing she thinks will help her find Ydgar. She also runs into Brixt, who is pursuing a not entirely dissimilar goal; something else interesting enough to make her the protagonist of her own story, so to speak.




When Ydgar sees Sidren, he assumes she’s the princess, because of the memories that are returned by seeing the hatchet...

Sidren drags Ydgar out of the Fort and hails a passing wagon (or other moving ... thing). They ride back, Ydgar close to death, barely conscious if at all. Sidren, still believing the bangle to be magical, puts it on him. Then, fearing that she will forget because of taking it off, she recounts the entire story to him, including details about her time in the fort. When she’s finished, she finally falls asleep, and is awoken by their disembarking. At this point she’s forgotten the fort (her memories extend so far as approaching it, and quickly fuzz as she enters; her mind supplies stuff to fill the blank, but it’s so conspicuous that she’s aware of the gap). Ydgar is pretty insensible at this point, and Sidren is basically dragging him to her one remaining hope; something unlikely... she begins to despair, and possibly suffers some injury (from a fight?) on the way, and is ready to give up, when Temperance appears. Temperance recognizes Ydgar, and takes both of them back to her house/whatever. She reveals to everyone (including herself) that she’s Ivearnoun, and she uses the Healing Act to save Ydgar.

Ydgar and Sidren are now in excellent health. Ivearnoun, having ended whatever spell her amnesia was creating/maintaining, leaves for the fort to retrieve her possessions. Her spell being ended, other players are moving, too... Sidren is interested in returning to Jororun, but Ydgar wants to



Sidren 

** scratchpad

Is the sun rising or setting?




Zwer: philosophizes that all things are composed of, and will return to, Air. Backs this up by saying that water "becomes air" (disappears" if left long enough; rocks shrink; anything thoroughly destroyed becomes dust, which is self-evidently more air-like than regular solids. Might claim that fire is an Act or ongoing set of Acts by which objects become, paradoxically, their own past selves.

Ivearnoun: says that Acts can only be created in ignorance; says that the whole world was created in ignorance, and the beginning of the earth is defined by Chaos, and that we progress outward and upward from there.

Theory: Sond is itself a memory-hole, a Fort. The first humans who settled there might have known this and tried to take precautions, but regardless, the first human society collapsed, and its history became muddled. What came out of that were: isolated pockets of agrarian human settlements... a built-in (genome editing?) recognition of some sort of written language (may or may not have happened after landing on the planet)... artifacts from the time of Chaos (old ships, "bronze / bronstone", stasis cannisters), "Statues", etc.









Sidren realizes, on the day that the caravan returns, that nobody can remember Ydgar. She is given a reason to believe that Guipathorme, a member of the caravan, could help her. She learns that the caravan is leaving, and she runs after it. She stops at home, first, and lies to her mother about where she’s going.






royal family are those who are given to perform primarily mental, rather than physical, tasks.
they do it logically. different jobs, different things they have to remember, but there ia some rredundancy.

when were candles invented? what are the earliest timekeepers? possibly a neighboring village lights candles constantly, one after the other, to track time.

people don't necessarily vale regularity the way moderns do... don't see life as discrete as moderns do. time is a little more elastic.








(how long is a year? other times?)

Brixt is captured in the same awful place, or just after leaving it, that Ydgar is trapped in, and Sid is obliged to leave her behind. After Ivearnoun, Ydgar convinces Sidren that instead of taking the easy way back home, safely, they should go back into danger (into the forgetful city) to look for Brixt.

When they get there, Brixt is dead (or otherwise permanently injured), but they make the best of their time in the awful place by finding and releasing a bunch more forgotten entities, and escaping with them.

The decision to “face them on the field”, made at the last moment (when escape proved impossible), comes from both Sidren and Ydgar. Sidren has the influence to try direct combat, while Ydgar has the audacity to suggest a frontal assault.

To cut the drawbridge, they use the only edged weapon any of them have (other than perhaps knives... what about obsidian, though?): the sword. At the last moment, when the realize they need to, Sidren gives the sword to [some bloke], who cuts the rope. She probably doesn’t get it back. Alternatively, she cuts it herself.

The sword being more remarkable would make it more remarkable that the Princess would give it up... also, it could turn out that the reason the Princess is forever a bachelorette is because of her forgotten love... that might ring some anti-feminist bells. Hard to say.



First part is dictated to Ydgar on the cart; second part is dictated by Sidren to her mother, I think, as some sort of explanation...? And then maybe a single section as part 3, a letter from the mother or something. Kind of don’t want to, but I need some way to cap it off.

Not sure whether Brixt or Temperance is the first to recognize Ydgar. Temperance if I want to draw out the dark period of the narrative; but then I might be double-dipping her as a twisty character. Brixt would add a little bit of hope before Brixt’s death. Probably Brixt.









(Note: what happens if A sees B in the fort, then A tells C about B, then A forgets B? Does C forget what A said about B? probably... probably the effect of the fort is such that, that entity within is simply removed from everyone else’s memory, and the hole covered up, regardless of how they came to be in the memory in the first place.)

(Note also: the fort doesn’t make you forget while you’re in it. This should be made clear beforehand, via some pattern that the fort ends up following. The fort affects those on the OUTSIDE, based on what/who is on the INSIDE.)

(Note also also: have to figure out, be careful about, how much about the fort Sidren remembers on her return visit. Maybe, since it’s a visual reminder, she remembers nothing until she sees it, but then the memories return quickly...?)

(Yet again... do you remember having forgotten? Do you remember what you can see from outside the walls? Do the people nearby remember that there’s a fort of some description nearby? Are they constantly surprised when they see it? Could they figure out that its effect is to make you forget? If the figured it out, could they remember this? START FROM THE KNOWNS AND DERIVE THESE UNKNOWNS!)

In any case. Brixt’s prospects, and the fort’s danger, must both be great enough to make both Ydgar’s urgings to return, and Sidren’s reluctance, more or less reasonable. HOWEVER, edge should go to Ydgar, since Sidren was already brave enough to go in once, to save him.
