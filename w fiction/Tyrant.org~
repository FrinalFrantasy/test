* judging Blackwell and the Tyrant
Connected to !!NONFICTION stuff about privilege and the effect of actions, and being able to track each successive second tier effects (effects-of-effects) only 1/nth as much as the first tier, and so on. For this reason, we concern ourselves primarily with the first tier effects of an action, and much less so with each successive tier, not because those repercussions don't matter, but because they're effectively unknowable.

So likewise, although the accomplishments of any individual person, though we know they are really a product of the myriad elements that came before them and contributed to their opportunities, abilities, and personality, it is appropriate to judge strongly what we see that they do, to the same extent that we judge our own actions according to their first tier effects. This is the justification used to praise Mary, and vilify the Tyrant.

"The tragedy which had brought out the worst in so many did bring out the best in a few... the force which persisted and defeated Z did so via the same mechanism by which Z wrought so much destruction: trust. / Trust is perhaps one of the most powerful forces... it adheres people/individuals to one another."
* outline
The tyrant was finally killed in eventual single combat by Mary Blackwell, after the latter breached his fortress with her band of friends/warriors (most of them dying in the process). The final face-off was not witnessed by anyone else. Mary survived, but was severely wounded: she lost an arm, lost sight in both eyes, had severe enough general injuries that she never fully recovered, and had extreme mental trauma which rendered her dependent for the remainder of her life. She was very well-loved for her heroics, and was well taken care of.

The tyrant was given a funeral, of a kind. After debate, his body was finally encased in a coffin and launched into space, aimed towards the emptiest portion of the sky. His only eulogy was this: "He did what he thought to be right."

The tyrant ^^name undecided^^ was responsible for one of the apocalyptic periods of the post-modernity era... maybe?
* The General's afterward
I wanted her to be my daughter, and at the same time I wanted her to be my wife. Maybe that sounds wrong. I just wanted to care for her. What she made into such fierceness was this vitality that I have never seen before or since. There was no one like her ever before in the world, I am sure. But even so, even with such power, she was hurt, and she had so much life in her that it hurt to see her hurt, and I wanted to protect her.

Apart from keeping her alive, I wanted, most of all, to help her free from the life of a struggle. She was a genius, as people say, but she really succeeded because of house much she gave up; I cannot even tell you how much she gave up. She loved dancing, and music, and math; people, and giving gifts; the nuns at the orphanage tell me []... she gave up so many things, to make herself into a weapon, the sharpest arrow that was ever fired at the heart of evil. And even if her energy were spent, even if the best years of her life were spent, she deserved to come out of the battle into peace, into a time and a place where she could sleep without a weapon on her thigh [reference; or similar memory]. But she didn't. X's last and final evil act was to bind her, forever I suppose, in battle with him. He is dead, and as physically gone as a person can be, and we are rebuilding, and still she is fighting him.

I wanted her to be my wife, and my daughter... I wanted to protect her. But I have had to face the fact, again and again, that I am not strong enough. I was, perhaps, a good general, but Mary was on a level above me, a level above all of us; by the wisdom of her teachers and the strength of her arm she raised herself up to a high enough level that she could strike at X. I wanted to protect her. When she was younger, I wanted her to be my daughter, and she wouldn't be, and I wondered why; when she was older, I wanted her to be my wife, and she wouldn't be, and I wondered why; now I know. She was too strong for both. I wanted to protect her, but this whole time, she's been protecting me. She's been protecting all of us.

Only now does she have real need... only in the decrepitude of her injuries is she a dependant being. But I will be neither her father nor her husband, nor even her commander anymore. I don't even know that you could call me precisely a friend. I go to her, still, almost every day, and sometimes I talk with her, or listen, and sometimes I only sit there, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred she doesn't seem to know I'm there, and if she knows I'm there, she doesn't know who I am. I don't know if I'm her friend, because friendship means giving and taking, and she has nothing left to give me, and I'm not sure I have anything left to give her, except my time; the nuns take care of her. Perhaps I'm only what I've always been: her admirer.
* The Tyrant's philosophical writings

A: There was speculation that the Tyrant's philosophical papers were themselves somehow poisoned or boobytrapped. Which, to be fair, was true - we lost one researcher to [plausible poison] in the ink when he handled some pages without gloves.

B: He's dead?

A: No, we caught it before it got that far, but he did go blind.

B: But it's not as though anyone would be convinced by reading...

A: ...

B: Was someone?

A1: People found individual sections very compelling.
A2: WEll, at least one did. We *accidentally* gave access to all of the info to one researcher. [or] Accidentally left the locks off. Anyway, he joined up. Tried to break into the vault. Assaulted a guard with a [deadly weapon]...

B: Jesus.

-: Hedge a bit. *Imply* that some people read it without going crazy (but are forbidden to discuss it openly), and/or there's some selection bias with those who sought out/chose to read.

* notes

The Tyrant is 81 at his death/the beginning of the novel. Blackwell is 36. The General is 54.

Five-Character Paradigm:
Higher rank only means that that entity has power over them, like a secret weapon. Does not necessarily mean that they want to or succeed in using it.

The final battle as a game of Crux:
+ Elder Beast in the Tower.
+ Suited K/N/M/W, and adult B suited to EB, enter bottom.
+ Suited K/M reach Tier 1, where M dies.
+ K enters castle, defeats EB, wins (K is champion I guess?).

The entire war as a game of Crux:
+ M killed early.
