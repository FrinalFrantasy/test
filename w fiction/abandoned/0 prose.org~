* The shallow sand
The shallow sand does not abide the foundations of a house, nor do the fields of dry rock. The living earth will suffer its body to be shaped and replaced by pillars of concrete and tooled wood, but only under protest. Harvey was deaf to these protests. As a young boy, he had climbed over the fence into a power station to look at a sparking transformer and was thrown to ground when it exploded, so he was deaf to most things, actually. He didn't hear the sounds the little bugs and worms made as he hammered wooden stakes into the ghround to mark the extent of his planned basement; he barely heard the hammer. He only heard his wife come down and tell him it was time for dinner if he turned his hearing aid on, which he only did after she came down and tapped him on the shoulder, so it didn't make a great deal of difference. He turned it off when he worked so it wouldn't interfere with his concentration, he turned it off when he slept so the faint buzzing wouldn't interfere with his sleep, and he turned it off in the house sometimes so that his wife would have to come right up to him to get his attention, and then he'd quick kiss her before she got away, which made her roll her eyes.

¡°Fifty-seven years old,¡± she would say, ¡°Fifty-seven years old, and still you act like we were nineteen.¡±

¡°I can't help it if you're as pretty now as you were when you were nineteen.¡±

¡°Well if that's true, then when I was nineteen I looked like an old woman, and I don't want to think about that.¡± And then she would walk off to finish cleaning the kitchen.
    
* I have not been gentle
I have not been gentle. I have not been wise. I have not been any of those things that I promised to be in that stone hut, so long ago. Patience I lost long ago, and temper, and the council of those I once held dear. I would have it now, but they would not have me, even were it possible; even if they were here. I have not been pure. I have not trusted God. I have not put aside myself. No, in only one way have I fulfilled the promises that I made, twenty-five months ago: I have not been idle.

I do not look to atonement. That is now beyond my reach. I live in the knowledge that, whatever I may do from now until the day that I die, it will not be enough. It may be that I will be hunted, and scourged, and chained, or even given pity; but none of these things will bring me peace. That I will have only when I have fallen asleep forever. But while I am a awake, I will suffer, and I will not complain.

When I was young, I acted rashly and blindly. When I took my oaths, I knew not what to do with my new responsibility (though I ought to have). In my indescritions that followed, even then, I followed my heart, drunkenly, without goal or purpose but the whims of the trice. But [it is] I am no longer so. All the clouds and veils have been pulled from before my face, and my path is laid bare, and there is no other. Though I have squandered nearly all of the gifts [?] that were given to be my charge, I have one left, the smallest morsel; yet this I will bear before me, and do with it what needs to be done [], and I will throw myself in thorns to keep it from touching the ground.

...and when the time came to do what must be done, as it had so often before, I was not conflicted/afraid...
...but when the time came to do what must be done, as it had so often before, I hesitated. My hand would not move. I was unable to strike.
I was not afraid... I was not even ashamed.... but my hand would not move. It would not obey me...

* I knew a man
I knew a man, at the academy. He was very poor, but he was an artist. A poet. He was very good with words. He used to tell me that I was...

We spoke of many things, as we sat nightly by the banks of the Hedron. He told me he wanted to take me away...

But I, being young and foolish, did not agree...
