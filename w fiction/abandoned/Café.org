CHAPTER 1: ROUGHLY CROSS-SHAPED

In a small café in Heidelberg, Germany—home of the castle of which Twain wrote in "A Tramp Abroad," the towering ruins of spiral staircases and statues of saints which overlooked the city—behind the street filled with trains powered by hanging wires and taxis driven by bicyclers in the front, across the river and in the glowing light of late evening sat two men, one slightly older than middle age and the other slightly younger, the first rather portly and the second rather thin, sipping large cups of coffee purchased for one and a quarter Euros each. They sat together both out of their old friendship, shaped from years of acquaintanceship and helping each other, and a simpler, more immediate dependency, for words were in their blood and conversation in their heads, and neither knew very good German. They sat and talked about the country, old and hard and stony, and the city, slow and fast together, and the castle, tall and proud yet broken, like a perfect pane of glass cracked, whole in shape and not in state. Their conversation ebbed and flowed with the falling of the sun and of the level of coffee (which was extremely good) in their cups, and as they spoke there was movement and life around them and in the corners of their eyes, to which they were too tired to pay attention. The older man said something to make the younger laugh, as was often the case, and when he quieted, still smiling down at his cup, they were silent, and remained so for some time.

The door of the café opened, a bell jingled, and a nondescript gentleman made his way to the counter.

"What you have to understand," said the older man, in a way that suggested it was a continuation of a conversation years old, "is that they're not valueless things. They are utilitarian, yes, but they can have class, and granduer, and, if you'll permit me to say it, majesty."

"Majesty?" repeated his companion, smiling again. It was a smile that would embarrass most people, but the older man was not embarrassed, perhaps because he knew the younger man, or perhaps because he was older.

"Yes, majesty. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to compare it to its counterparts of old, your favorite toys—" (the younger man feigned offense) "—I told you that I think the analogy is unsuitable. They're too different and unique to warrant such treatment as all that. I would as soon compare a mace and a crossbow."

"I could do that, actually," said the younger man, "I know just what angle to take; I compare the spikes of the mace to the tip of the arrow—"

"Thank you," said the older man loudly over his companion.

"Yes. Go on."

"There are only two things that keep the weapon in my pocket from being treated with the respect it ought to receive from you artists. The first is its modernness—and we can't have anything modern, now can we? The second is its complexity. Mind you there are things a thousand times more complex, things that are renowned purely for their complexity and which you would not hesitate to dedicate a poem to, I'm sure. The Labyrinth of Crete, the calculations of Galileo, the floor-plan of that castle. . . " He paused to take a sip of coffee. "Years from now, many years, when wars are fought with bright lights and fields of energy and willless machines, their poems and paintings will be to the revolving cylinder and the leather grip and the eye trained across the sights."

The door of the café opened, a bell jingled, and a teenager wearing punk clothing walked to a counter stool and sat down.

"You're a romantic," said one of the two men.

"So're you," replied the other.

There was another pause as cups were lifted to sets of lips.

The younger man said, "I think it's really the immediacy of the gun that sets it apart from other weapons. I mean, you could get shot and not die for hours or days, but the shot itself, that's instantaneous for all intents and purposes. With a sword or a knife or some other bladed weapon, the strike itself can take a few seconds. Even with a bow and arrow you have the whistle of the bolt through the air for a moment before it hits."

"That is my point exactly," said the older man. "You said 'sets apart,' and that's what I mean. The gun and the sword are not analogous, or if they are, only in their following the logical procession from, say, a club; a club anyone could kill with, but if two men fought with clubs and one was better, it would quickly show. With swords the difference is smaller, because the weapon is more potent, more able to kill regardless of the ability of the killer. The gun takes the difference even further, so that anyone with a good eye or a slow target can potentially kill them. Another way to put it would be to say that the element of chance is increased, which, now that I think of it, probably ties into the fact that the gun is seen as less interesting of a weapon. But I think the chance involved is healthy; it keeps you aware of irony, and of your own mortality, and perhaps of fate."

"Perhaps." said the younger man, his smile faint but present.

"Perhaps." repeated the older man, his own smile obvious. "Now, take the gun in my pocket."

"But I've already got one."

"Very funny. Take the gun in my pocket _for instance_. My gun has been fired by different people, by my late friend, by me, and in one unfortunate instance, _at_ me, but ultimately I'm the one who still carries it and the initials on the hilt are mine."

"Hilt?"

"What? I meant handle. I meant handle. Be quiet. Anyway, this gun is still mine and I know it very well. I know how it handles and when it won't and I can hit damn near every time with it. And there have been times, yeah, when I'm running one way and shooting another, and I can't tell if I'm hitting anything or just making noise and wasting shells, and it seems like a bit of warm metal in my hand. But there are other times. . . " and here the older man leaned forward and dropped his voice, so that his companion had to turn one ear closer and stay quiet to hear, "When I've put man or a woman on their knees and held this gun to their head, and pulled the hammer back until I get that metal click, and seen a fear in their faces that's the fear of exactly that immediacy you mentioned, that _now_-ness of an unstoppable bullet tearing through their head and leaving it open and leaking stuff onto the ground around them. That's when you know that that little piece of metal in your hand is Death, death by fire and destruction."

"Yeah. . . " said the younger man, seemingly in awe. "And have you ever done that?"

"Of course I have," said the older man, leaning back, arms folded.

"When?"

"Oh, lots of times."

"Yeah? To who?"

"It's 'whom.'"

"To whom?"

"You know. Assholes, mostly."

The younger man laughed, throwing back his head, so that the rest of the café glanced at him.

"You really have a way with words, you know that?" he said, when he had recovered.

"Thanks," said the older man, grinning on one side of his mouth.

"You're also a fucking liar."

"Eh, it's a fair cop."

It was a few moments before the younger man asked, "How many times have you actually killed with that gun?"

"If they were years, they would be sufficient payment to Laban to marry Leah," said the older man, didactically.

"And you're not irreconcilably burdened with guilt and sorrow, I see."

"Well, I'm not _proud_ of what I've done, but I'm not embarrassed. I'd never kill someone if I didn't have to."

The younger man raised his eyebrows. "Really?"

The older man's one-sided smile returned. "Yeah."

The door of the café opened and slammed against the wall, the bell jingled wildly, and a short woman in black clothing, completely soaked, breathing heavily and looking furious stood in the doorway.

"Good lord," said the older man.

"She's found us."

"So she has."

"Gilligan Cross and Jo-Jo Jay," the woman began to shout, "By the authorities of the United States government, German government, French government, African government, and special United Nations order, I hereby place you under immediate and full arrest!"

"But those aren't our real names!" protested the younger man, satirically.

"They'll _fucking_ do!" screamed the woman.

"May I finish my coffee?" asked the older man.

The woman, perhaps low on patience and in need of a strong coffee herself, pulled a black handgun from her waist holster and pointed it at the two men. Her next words were quieter, and delivered, while not through clenched teeth, certainly through a clenched jaw.

"Come. With. Me. _Now_."

The two men glanced very briefly at one another.

"By fire and steel!" roared the older man, leaping from the table while drawing a brown-handled revolver.

"Death before capture!" shouted his companion, leaping in the opposite direction, already firing his pistol, which was a much newer silver affair.

Customers of café began to scream and run away in panic, diving towards exits or under table. The punk teenager, who had been mentally preparing for this event ever since he had seen his first action film, threw his stool through a window and jumped out after it. The young girl behind the counter began to dial the police, but a stray bullet (the woman in wet clothing had thrown herself onto the floor and returned fire on the two men) shattered the telephone in her hand and she squeaked and ducked back behind the counter.

It may be convenient here to describe the layout of the café: it was roughly cross-shaped, with the main entrance at the bottom edge, the counter at the top, and separate round tables (now, in most cases, toppled over) spread out variously throughout. The two gentlemen’s table had been exactly in the middle of the cross, and they now found cover each in one of the short arms of the cross, crouched or lying semi-prone on the floor, able to peek their head or gun around the corner at the woman. Windows adorned most of on half of the café, and extra light was provided by attractive hanging lamps (septagonal and orange-red). The music playing was some lighthearted German pop song, from the sound of it a rip-off of a similar American song, though what song exactly it would have been impossible to determine. It was played because it was popular with the customers, which would be the mildly artistic crowd, and it got rather old after a while (if you’re wondering whether the end of that sentence referred to the music or the crowd, the answer is yes). The only employee who cared enough or was sensitive enough to really abhor hearing the same semi-decent music every day at work was the young girl then hiding, scared, behind the counter, whose name was Annalina. The reader should be warned, however, that while giving Annalina her name would, in most novels, be a veritable guarantee of some predestination for importance for her character, that is not necessarily the case presently, and she may in fact be killed off for shock value. Only time will tell.

Crouched behind an overturned circular table (which, remarkably, was bulletproof), the woman continued to fire at the two men alternatively as they popped their heads or hands out to return the favor. She was a good shot, perhaps better than the younger of the two men (though certainly not the older), and the force of anger and adrenaline made her attack so ferocious that, for the moment, she had her two opponents on the defensive (if the point must be made that hiding behind a circular café table is, too, a defensive tactic, perhaps the reader will be content with the elaboration that she had her two opponents in a _more_ defensive position than her own). For perhaps a full minute the air was crowded with the sounds of gunshots and screaming, and then it waned as the various parties involved had to reload their weapons, and also noted with varying degrees of interest that it seemed that no bullet had yet hit its mark.

Two clips were slammed into pistols, while the older man refilled his revolver with a quiet _click, click_ing sound.

“I really don’t know why you use that thing, Jo-Jo,” said the younger man.

“Yes, you do, and if you make me tell you again I’ll shoot you.”

“Come out!” shouted the woman. After a moment she added, “Out!”

_Click, click_ went Jo-Jo’s revolver as Gilligan aimed wildly around the wall and succeeded in taking out one of the hanging lamps.

“Listen,” said the woman after this sort of thing had continued for another minute, “You have no idea how much authority I represent right now. If you two have even the smallest ounce of respect for human institution, you will come with me.”

“Respect doesn’t enter into it!” said Jo-Jo. “What you’re encountering here is self-preservation. Why do you think we bloody came to _Germany_?”

“I really don’t know, considering that you’re wanted here.”

“Oi, Jo-Jo,” said Gilligan. “We came here for the castles and shit.”

“Oh. Yes, now I remember. The castles and the beer.” Jo-Jo spent a luxurious moment, or maybe two, reminiscing inwardly of the castles and the beer, and his eyes stared off in the general direction of Neptune. It ended with Gilligan saying,

“It was a good plan, though. I mean, there was no way to track us, we had those extra passports, we’ve been in disguise nearly the whole time. I thought we’d have two weeks, at least, because we were found.”

“Oh, no,” said the woman, and one or two laughs squeezed through her breaths as she crouched behind the table. “Not this time. It was hard, but I found you. You forgot something. You slipped up.”

Gilligan looked his question, but Jo-Jo shrugged. They were silent for an awkward length of time.

“Um. . . and how would that be?” asked Gilligan.

The woman paused the sort of pause that makes one think that the speaker has failed to stop him or herself from saying saying something they’re not sure they ought to tell.

“Troy,” she said, and an evil-looking grin that neither man could see seized her face. She was not accustomed to adrenalin, and it had her almost intoxicated. “I found your friend Troy. I was at a bar in New York, and there he was. I recognized him from that picture of you with the airplane.

Gilligan grimaced, and glanced across the gap at Jo-Jo. “Didn’t I tell you I was wondering what I had done with that picture?”

“He told me everything,” continued the woman. “I bought him some whiskey and he just spilled it all. I felt like I was in a bad movie, it was so easy. He told me about your new names, and your passports, and how you worked with Eddie Chavez. I though he was lying, at first, but he wasn’t. It all checked out.”

A thick silence presented itself to the woman as each of the men faced various inner demons and doubts. Gilligan, as usual, was the first to speak, but unlike usual, his words were terse and cold.

“And what, Agent Olive Harper, did Troy have to say about Eddie Chavez?”

“He told me you worked for him. Both of you. Not for long, but long enough to get a handle on what Eddie’s doing, and long enough to get your hands dirty in the process. One more than the other of you, though.”

“But. . . not last March, right?” said Jo-Jo.

“Yeah,” said the woman, “last March.”

There was a shifting sound, like the sound you feel like you’re making when you try to change positions in a quiet theater, and the two men were pointing their guns at each other.

“You said you were sick last March,” said Jo-Jo.

“You told me you never worked with Eddie Chavez,” replied Gilligan.

“No, I didn’t, I just never told you that I did.”

“Bullshit, it’s the same thing, with Eddie.”

“What about last March, then?”

“You tell me what you did with Eddie and I’ll tell you what I did last March.”

“You tell me what you did last March or I’ll shoot your hand off your arm.”

“Two can play at that.”

The thick silence returned. The woman seemed taken aback by the exchange, and didn’t say anything.

“How long have we known each other, Jo-Jo?” asked Gilligan in a very different voice.

Jo-Jo scratched his chin with his free hand. “Too long for this, surely.”

Gilligan thought for a moment. He said, “When I met you—
