Markku stood among an expanse of white. It was not a bright white, despite its pureness, but a white of emptiness, a placeholder for the world. It was very silent, and as vast as the expanse felt, there was no echo. It was not so much sound that was transmitted with each footfall as Markku stepped down onto the low floor, but the feeling, the thought of the step. Markku stopped and looked across the expanse, at the center of it all. It was impossible to determine that it was the center, yet it seemed genuinely obvious that it was there. It wasn't far off, maybe two dozen yards, or maybe a mile, and hovering just there was a singular light, infinitely small, a minuscule pinprick of whiteness. It was surrounded by a spherical shell of light, maybe blue or orange, that pulsed slowly and relaxedly along the very edges of the expanse.
"Hey," said a man's voice. Markku turned, and there he was, standing a short distance away, looking at her. He was a tallish, handsome man, maybe thirty-five, with short brown hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a clean, dark blue jacket over a dress uniform of some kind. His expression was warm, and very relaxed; he looked as though he were the kind of person who didn't relax enough.
"You're here?" said Markku, though not surprised at his presence.
"Strange thing to say, considering you don't know who I am." said the man, smiling.
"I guess." said Markku, looking back at the point of light. "Am I asleep?"
"I think so." The man came up next to her.
"What is that?" Markku asked, staring at the light.
"It's, um, a knot, I think. That's what it feels like, at least. It's where we- well, it's where I sleep."
Markku turned to look at him, and saw the point of light reflected in his eyes.
"I mean, it's not a place. . ." he continued, uncertainly, "but it's that feeling, that sense of being awake or asleep. I can feel it, or at least I think I can, just behind my eyes." He put his hand on his temple as though trying to find the spot. "The more sleepy you are, the more pressure there is on the point, and if there's enough pressure, the light breaks through the point and sort of folds around the place. That's what the spherical light is." He gestured at the shell of light, still pulsing slowly around them. "It's, ah, I guess it's a sort of visual representation of consciousness. The pressure can't break through if there's too much in the way, like noise or light, things that keep you from getting to sleep. The main key is when you lie down and close your eyes. . . that releases the pressure from a sort of bond. That's why you don't fall asleep while standing up. Or, well, you usually don't." He smiled softly.
"Why can I see yours?" Markku asked.
"I think you're seeing your own, actually." the man said. "They just happen to be in the same place right now. That's why we can see each other."
"Strange thing for a figment of my subconscious mind to say." Markku said, smiling amusedly.
"Do you really think that's what I am?" the man said.
Markku was silent for a moment.
"No."
They stood in silence for several seconds before he spoke again.
"My name's Gold. Gold Smith."
"Your first name is 'Gold?'" asked Markku.
"Yes." said Gold, looking rather surprised. "Is there something strange about that?"
"Nope." said Markku, smiling again. She stretched her arms, noticing for the first time that she was wearing a loose t-shirt and a pair of jeans; an outfit she hadn't worn in ages. It was absurdly comfortable. "I'm Markku Gairden."
"Markku." said Gold, as though trying the name out. "I don't think I've ever heard a name like that before. Is it Maersian?"
"Finnish, actually. It means rebellious'." She grinned. "What does your name mean?"
"Uh, ‘soft metal,' I think. I don't remember exactly." He shrugged apologetically.
There was silence once more. After a while Markku asked "What year is it, where you come from?"	
"I'm. . . not sure. It never seemed to make much difference. What year is it for you?"
"2225. It's fuzzy, though. I only know that because I can remember how old I am. Time doesn't seem to be nearly as important as names, when you're dreaming."
Gold nodded. He thought about something for a moment, then said "I don't remember what year I was born in. But I remember one day, when I was a kid, that I looked it up on the calender, and saw that if I had been on Earth, it would've been during the time when the leaves fall off the trees." He turned to her, his eyes suddenly full of memory and sadness. "Have you ever seen a tree? A real tree?"
"Yes," said Markku quietly, "but not a big one, not for a long time now. I remember there were big trees when I was little, trees so thick you couldn't get your arms around them. . ." she stretched out her arms in remembrance, then dropped them again, embarrassed. "But that might have just been because I was little."
Markku stood there, thinking of her childhood, looking at the spark of light, and suddenly she felt tears running down her cheeks. She could not have known, she could not have possibly imagined at that age how lucky she was, to look at the world with wonder, to be carefree and happy; she remembered the little girl she had met during the autumn, the little girl who reminded her so much of herself, except that she had a mother and a father to run back to, a home when someone took that wonderful world of colors and trees away—
Gold had put his arms around her, and she was sobbing into his chest, her memories coming loose in a flood of emotion.
"I wanted to be a guardian, and instead I became a soldier. . . I dreamt of being a builder, and yet I am the architect of nothing but death. . ." she looked up into his face, into the sadness reflected in his eyes, and felt, for a moment, the same love she had once felt for a man she had betrayed.
"Can I ever be forgiven?" she whispered, her head still pressed against his chest, close enough to hear the slow beating of his sleeping heart. Gold stroked her hair gently, and looking into her eyes he said, very softly, "Yes."
It was a long time before the tears stopped coming. Finally, Markku wiped her face with her hand and said "Will I remember all this when I wake up?"
"I'm sure you will." said Gold. "It will help if you write it down, though. It's always easier to remember a dream if you write it down right away."
"Will I remember you, though? Will I remember that I knew that you were real, and not just a part of my imagination?"
Gold hesitated, then answered "I don't think so. What you know and what you don't know are very subjective there. But does it really matter? Isn't this enough?"
Markku didn't answer, just held him close to her. They continued to stand there as the minutes or hours past, and as the whiteness grew and the sphere of light faltered, and even as the sounds of people running and shouting pressed against the sphere until it dissolved, and the spark of light flared to life, and she woke up. The barracks was alive with activity, Sentinels running to and from their stations, Officers barking orders, her own computer beeping at her to get her attention. Markku ignored it all, however, and just lay there, taking in the dream. She opened her eyes held her hand in front of her face, now dry, as though she had never wiped her tears away with it. She closed her eyes again, imagining while the image was still strong in her mind the man, the one in her dream, who had known her far better than anyone but herself could have. She thought about the spark of light, and about trees, and about the man.
"Yes," she said, very quietly.
