Humanity

by Nathaniel Rhein

(my first finished story)

!!!

Sunlight streamed uncertainly through the canopy of trees, casting obscure shadows on the forest floor below, and on the small house residing there. The trees swayed gently, sending a few birds looking for new places to land, ignoring the fallen tree next to the house, or the young man lying on it. It was an undoubtedly beautiful day, the kind that made you want to just take a long walk through the trees and momentarily forget about the rest of your life.

But not to Ardo Jefferson. His back on the tree and his hands under his head, he watched the perfect day.

Too perfect, he thought. It feels like a storm is coming. A big one, too. He closed his eyes rather wistfully. But it's such a nice day... and it feels so nice just to lie here...

No.

He opened his eyes again and sat up on the log. His jeans were ripped and his T-shirt felt itchy, like grass had gotten in it; an all too-well known feeling for him. He jumped off the tree and hit the ground hard, but braced himself. He knew this forest like the back of his hand, and this old tree was one of his favorite resting spots. He stood up and closed his eyes again, this time feeling the air. Definitely moist. Drat. He opened his eyes again and looked around.

“Merlin!” he shouted.

No answer.

“Merrrrrrrliiiiiiin!” he called again.

A faint barking noise.

Ardo looked quickly in the direction the bark had come from and sped off that way. He was very tall and very thin, being a perfect candidate for the word gangly. He had large, rough hands and short, curly hair always full of pine cones or small twigs or other forest apparel. He moved skillfully through the trees, quickly but silently, hardly disturbing the animals on the way. How many times had he done this before?...

Ardo popped out into another small clearing and shouted loudly, “Merlin!” causing every animal around him to run off in fright.

Except one, Ardo thought to himself, smiling slightly as a furry brown comet came hurtling through the clearing, barking loudly and happily, right before slamming into Ardo and nearly knocking him off his feet.

“Hey, big guy, how you doin'?” he said, and then “Ewwch!” as Merlin licked his ears happily. Merlin was a large, friendly dog with a strange thing for trying to play with the animals in the forest. His gray fur was also filled with bits of the forest but he cared as little as Ardo did.

Ardo shoved Merlin off of him and ruffled his hair. He knew he had to get back soon to have time to secure and protect everything for the storm. Doing so was not exactly a highlight of Ardo's lifestyle, but he knew it must be done. His mother helped where he could and so did Ardo's sister Jennifer, but for the most part it was just him. It was a simple and rather boring life, Ardo thought sometimes, but he liked it just fine. Between working in the forest or on the house he would have time to read, write or just walk around the forest, admiring nature.

The air was more moist now but now there was something else... a cold, metallic kind of feeling that Ardo didn't recognize. He thought about this, following Merlin back home through the growing wind.

Nearly nine miles above, a storm was brewing.  Icy wind whined through air that crackled with electricity. Blasts of thunder created a deafening background to the white gale. Snow and ice swirled through the air, rendering the silvery, descending shapes nearly invisible.

Down below, in the city of Reubon, Jonathan Gale sat uncomfortably at a public telephone, cursing his contact. Lyssa Watts read a letter from her son while typing up some information for her boss. Daniel Morwood drew a picture of what he thought looked like an absolutely picturesque little book shop. Diane Acker walked down Jay Avenue, the way she had for the past six years, for the last time in her life.
A storm was brewing.

“Looks like a storm's comin', ma!” Ardo called, kicking open the screen door because his hands were full of perishables. Merlin bounded into the house, nearly smashing into the kitchen table, ran haphazardly into the living room, barked madly at a mouse that wasn't there, rolled on his back and fell asleep. Ardo tipped his load carefully on the counter and walked into the living room. His sister was sitting on the couch reading a magazine and his mother was hammering a nail into the wall for some unknown reason.

“I hope you got the-” she began.

“Yes, ma.”

“And you're going to-'”

“Yes, ma.”

She turned around and fixed him with an accusing stare.  Ardo grinned sheepishly.

“Uhh... sorry, mom.” he said, trying not to smile. She looked at him for a moment longer, then smiled too.

“Sometimes I just don't know where I went wrong with you.” she said, dramatically. “You are going to the store later today, right?” she added, turning back to the nail. Ardo groaned.

“You know I don't like to hear that, Ardo.” she said as he mouthed the words with her.

“Yes, ma, I'm going to the store later.” he said resignedly.

“And then...” she said, leading him on.

“I'll finish my chores. I know, mom.”

“I'm not worried about you knowing, I'm worried about you doing.” she replied matter-of-factly. Ardo sighed and walked up to his room to rest and maybe take a shower before he had to fulfill his mother's tyranny.

!!!

Dusk. The clouds above were gray and scared with lightning, seeming to create a barrier between the earth and the sky. To anyone who could see, the swirling clouds and flashes of brilliant lighting would have been nearly indistinguishable from the large, silver-gray shapes coming through the bottom of the clouds, their hulls scared with ice and snow.

!!!

Half an hour later, throwing a worried glance at the darkening sky, Ardo sped down toward the supermarket on his bike. He said quick hellos to a few people he knew and a few he didn't. He stopped only once for traffic. Passing by the electronics store with its TVs out on display he caught the words “strange anomalies.” He raced passed crowds of people in the central park, all gathered around telescopes and looking at the sky. Just a buncha' stupid rain clouds, what's there to look at? he thought, narrowly missing a parked car. He braked to a halt in front of the supermarket, hopping off the bike to park it momentarily, and glanced casually at the sky.

The bicycle clattered to the ground. Ardo's eyes widened. He stared up, up at the sky, at something that could not be. The dark clouds were shifting and moving rapidly and small flickers of lightning filled otherwise dark patches, but clearly seen, just beneath the clouds were-

No... The silver shapes were obviously moving downwards. There were about a dozen of them, spaced evenly throughout several miles. Ardo stumbled backward into the shop. He felt cold. He opened his mouth to talk to the manager, Mr. Mann, but he spoke first.

“I know. Seen 'em just ten minutes ago.”

Ardo took a long breath. “What are they?” he said, not taking his eyes off the window.

“No one knows. People say they're aliens. Been on the news a few minutes.”

Ardo looked at the small, black and white television on the counter. Seen on the local news channel was a rough picture of the scene outside.

“...First appeared about twenty minutes ago. Both leaders confirmed that they are not aircraft from either nation. What you are looking at we do not know. Science fiction enthusiasts and” (the picture switched to the newsman  speaking) “believers in extra terrestrials have insisted that these are real U.F.O.s and have gathered together in parks and streets to try to communicate with them. We... we do not know what these are or where they came from.” The newscaster wiped his forehead with his sleeve. “The images you are seeing are live and have not been tampered with.” The picture switched back. Ardo looked down at his hand and saw that it was clenched on the counter next to him, white. He yanked his hand away and grabbed it with his other, closing his eyes and breathing heavily, waiting for it to pass. His mind was racing with what he had just seen. Aliens. No! Aliens don't... they don't... MOM! His eyes snapped open again.

“What do you think?” he said, trying to keep his voice steady. Mr. Mann took a long look at him. “I've kept a rifle under this counter for the past three years, in case someone robs me.” he said. “I never kept any ammo with it. The rifle alone will scare them away.” He looked out the window again. “Whatever they are, it doesn't matter. I'm keeping it loaded today.”

Ardo looked at him. There wasn't anything to say. He turned around and ran back out the door. Climbing back on his bike, he took another glance at the sky. The sight of it felt like it burned his eyes, but he looked anyway. It as impossible to tell any details from this distance, but he could tell that they had already gotten closer. Feeling the first drops of the storm, he sped off on his bike back to his house, his heart pounding. The rain was picking up now, and he could hear some lightning. As he approached the central park he was forced to stop by the throng of people gathered there. He looked around. The people were frantic, panicked, constantly looking at the sky. There was no way through. There were too many people. There was no time to think. No time to decide. Ardo turned and rode off to the left. It was a much longer route, but it was the only way.

For the next ten minutes, he was uninhibited. The rain had seeped down through his clothes now and was beginning to slosh against the wheels of the bike. He started to pass by more people, people running around with canned food and duct tape, people gathering their children indoors from the storm. Passing through a road crossing filled with yet more people looking at the sky, terrified, Ardo felt a strange heat pass over him. He looked up in time to see the subtle rippling of space created by the exertion of energy from the oncoming ship. Ardo felt his skin burn and was blinded by light as the shock wave threw him off his bike. He screamed in midair as he flew nearly fifteen feet onto the grass, ears ringing and eyes searing from the blast. He lay there, face down, for a moment. He couldn't hear anything. He stood up shakily. Blood ran down the side of his head. He saw the blurred outline of the ship, not thirty feet away, seeming to ripple in the heat from its engines. Ardo stumbled backwards, backing away. The ship began tèo lower its long, shining legs to the ground, but Ardo didn't stay to watch. Limping slightly he ran off, still the the direction of his house, blood and dirt stinging his eyes

!!!

The first ship to land was in the southern district of the city. The air burnt around it and the old car parked near the spot was melted down to slag before the ship had even touched the ground. When it did, the ground shook and trembled slightly. The small crowd assembled there grew, if possible, more tentative. There was a group of alien enthusiasts there with flashlights and pencils and paper, hoping against hope that their long wish for communication with extra terrestrials was at hand. They looked at the ship and saw possibilities for communication, technology.  Some held cameras, snapping off rolls and rolls of pictures. They looked at the ship and saw a story or a conspiracy or anything else. A few men were holding guns, looking worried and tense. They looked at the ship and saw an enemy, a source of evil. Mothers and fathers were holding their children, some watching through windows or hiding inside their houses. They looked at the ship and saw fear, impossibility, anything but goodness.

A sudden hush filled the clearing as the engines on the craft stopped. No one moved.

The ship opened.

!!!

Ardo stopped for a moment. His breath was catching in his chest now and his eyes still hurt. The rain was making it difficult to see. He sank down against a rusty fence. He still didn't believe what he had just seen. He couldn't bear to look upwards again; more and more of the silvery behemoths had been descending out of the clouds for the past half hour. Still he did not know what they were. Aliens? His mind hurt. The thought was too terrible. What if they're not here to attack? But of course they're here to attack... No! They're not aliens!

Than what are they?

He stood up and began to run again. He didn't know where he was, but he could still tell which way his house was. Running through some old alleyways, he stopped. There was a crowd of people there. And there, in the middle of the street-

The ship was large, at least as large as a small house. It had six legs, all of which had dug several feet into the earth in the landing. The ground beneath it was scorched black.

The ship was already opening. The loud sound of mechanical gears filled the air as a horizontal crack appeared about three feet off the ground and began to grow. For the space of a minute, no one moved. Ardo could hardly breath. The grinding stopped when the opening was about six feet tall. The sounds of another, interior door opening came too, and smoke poured out of the space. When it cleared, three shapes stood there. Short, squat shapes with huge, bulbous heads. They were white, mostly, and their skin looked like it had been draped over them. One of them was holding what looked like a long piece of pipe. One of the woman screamed. The shapes- they're aliens, I can't pretend to not know that- turned sèharply to her. Suddenly Ardo realized that the large things were not their heads. They were helmets. They have space-suits on. Ardo could see now that the white “skin” was some kind of loose clothing. One of the aliens looked at its wrist, then gestured to the other two. Suddenly the glass helmets retreated into the suits, leaving their heads bare. They had small, close set eyes and large mouths. Their entire face looked like it was pointing forward. With the helmets gone, their heads looked very small in contrast to their suits.

The front alien, who seemed to be the leader, stepped forward. “Eca ep'ni'em oc'ew's gni teerg!” it shouted. Many of the people backed away, horrified. Only some of them remained, the ones who wanted to communicate. They were as scared as anyone else, but they were determined. One of them opened his mouth, but one of the aliens behind the leader turned to face him and said something else, equally incomprehensible. The man paused, than said in a shaky, but strong voice, “Greetings, friends. We will not harm you.” The aliens stared at him. For a long moment, no one said anything. Then one of the other men, visibly shaking, began to walk forward. The woman screamed again and several people shouted “Stop!” but he continued on. When he reached the aliens they backed away, apparently in fear. The one with the cylindrical object raised it slightly. The man stopped just in front of the leader and extended his arm. His friends behind him were pale with fear, but they said nothing. The other two aliens looked nearly as apprehensive as the people did. Then, very slowly, the alien held out its arm, mimicking the man. A wave of relief washed visibly over the man's face, and he took the alien's hand to shake.

He realized his mistake too late. The front alien made a loud noise and retreated backward, while the other two stepped up, looking like bodyguards. The one with the cylinder pointed it threateningly at the man and shouted something. He backed away, scared as ever, and didn't say anything. Then, without warning, one of the men behind him, holding a shotgun, shouted “They'll kill us all!” and fired it at the aliens.

He missed, but on purpose. He stepped forward as the aliens made strange noises and backed away. The man stopped in front of them, pointing the shotgun at them, and said “Go back to where you came from, monsters!” The leader alien said something quietly to the one with the cylinder, who raised it. There was a flash of light and a deafening noise as the man's head exploded in a shower of blood. Half the people behind them screamed loudly. Everyone else with a gun yelled and charged forward, firing. The leader backed away and ran back into the ship. The other two aliens moved forward, resetting their helmets as the one without the weapon pulled an identical one from a strap on its leg. There were a few moments of terrible confusion as the aliens and the people fired away at each other. Through the smoke Ardo could vaguely make out that one of the aliens seemed to had died, and the other was backing away quickly. The first's helmet had shattered, and it was covered in dark red blood. For a moment it seemed as though they had won, but than the ship opened again and six more aliens came out. Woman were screaming. Men were yelling. Ardo looked on with horror. His legs didn't seem to be working. Suddenly one of the aliens caught sight of him, and fired. Ardo ducked just in time as a tree behind him erupted in flame. Then he ran, faster than he ever had or thought he ever could, the sounds of the melee ringing in his ears, and he could only hope that none of the aliens had followed him. After a moment he slowed down back to a healthier pace and looked around for the hill his house was on. He spotted it instantly, but the sight made his stomach plummet. SMOKE!. Ardo turned pale. A thousand horrific images filled his mind at the same time, blocking out pain or endurance. He ran again, faster, if possible, toward his house. When he finally reached there...

The trees were burnt and splintered. There were small craters in the ground. The house was burning wildly, even in the pouring rain, and there were two small, blackened shapes at the base of it, looking as if they had been trying to run. Ardo's vision blurred. Tears swelled in his eyes as he sank to his knees and threw up. He tried to stand up again, but he was shaking uncontrollably and it was difficult. He clenched his fists on the fence there to keep them from twitching and leaned against it, sobbing loudly.

He stayed there for nearly ten minutes. When he got up he walked toward the house, unable to look at the bodies. He got to the emergency door to the cellar, and saw that it was intact. He unlocked it and jumped it. The basement was fairly the same, though the regular door was splintered and broken, and Ardo could see flame beyond it. He went over to the wall and took his father's old hunting rifle carefully from its glass case. He opened the drawer there and took the box of ammunition, too. Climbing back outside, Ardo turned instinctively to lock the door again. He turned around again and found himself face to face with an alien.

“Enoreh tona's'ereh!” it shrieked. Without thinking, Ardo lifted the rifle and fired. Crimson blood sprayed backwards as the alien reeled, screaming a terrible, high-pitched scream. Ardo reloaded and shot again. The alien fell backwards, blood now coming from its mouth. Ardo fired again, and again, and again, more out of fury than anything. He heard a noise behind him. Whirling around, he saw two more of them, helmets up. He shot at one and the glass shattered and flew everywhere, but he had missed its head. He fumbled around for more of the bullets, but another alien caught him with some long, sharp weapon. Ardo fell down, pain searing through his back. He pointed the gun up at them but the alien wrenched it from his hands. Trying to see, blinking out blood, Ardo could just make out the aliens, running over to examine their dead companion. The one above him deactivated his helmet. The other two, looking down at the dead one, looked at the one above Ardo and shook their heads.

“Alien scum!” it spat, and shot him.

!!!

Miles and miles above, seeming to be calmly watching the chaos below, a gigantic mothership orbited the planet leisurely.

“Commander? Sergeant Hunt, sir.” said one of the aliens aboard, saluting.

“Show him in.”

Sergeant Warren Hunt strode into the room, looking worried, and saluted as well.

“At ease.” said the commander. “Status report?”

“Yes sir.” replied Hunt. “Troops arrived on-planet at oh-nine hundred hours. Seventy-one of seventy-four ships landed successfully. One had an engine malfunction and was forced to resume orbit. Two were caught in the electromagnetic storm and the men are considered MIA. According to the men down there, the aliens are putting up a fair fight, but their weapons and technology are severely primitive compared to ours.'”

“Casualties?”

“Thirty-seven men dead, eighteen missing or without communication capabilities.”

“And the aliens?”

Hunt fidgeted slightly. “Probably thousands, sir.”

“Thank you. You may go.”

Hunt didn't move.

“I said, you may go.”

“Sir, I'm afraid we're doing this the wrong thing here .”

The commander looked at him. “You aren't really in a position to criticize, Hunt.”

Hunt sighed deeply. “Commander Alekman, these are peaceful beings. It would be beneficial for us to attempt communication and peace rather than-”

“Than what, sergeant?”

Hunt paused. “...Than to simply wipe out an entire planet, sir.”

“We didn't come to wipe out a planet. We tried to communicate. These creatures are uncivilized and do not understand-”

“That's not true!” Hunt said, angrily. “We didn't give them the chance! Of course they're violent, the people of Earth would be too if aliens started landing out of the blue on the planet!”

“And that is what we are preventing, Hunt.” said Alekman.

Hunt closed his eyes. “With all due respect, sir, I believe your judgment is flawed. They are not violent beings. If we could only communicate with them, work something out, we could avoid all this bloodshed and create advances in human knowledge and understanding like never before!”

“We will understand plenty! And do not forget; the only reason we came to this planet in the first place was because without it mankind will whither and die! There is no other planet with breathable air for hundreds of light-years. We need this planet.”

“At the cost of an entire civilization, sir?”

“If need be, yes.”

“Sir...” Hunt began again, choosing his words carefully. “Sir, what does this planet remind you of?”

“What do you mean?” said Alekman, impatiently.

“This planet's composition and general climate are nearly identical to that of Earth just fifty years ago. An Earth where we haven't already wasted all the resources and ruined the planet. A new Earth.”

“Which is exactly why we are here!”

“Sir, I do not believe you would be likely to sit by and watch the human race become merciless dominators, taking planets and resources from wherever we see fit.”

Alekman fixed him with a deep look. “I do not need lectures on philosophy, sergeant. This day will mark one of the most important times in human history. Our people need guidance and leadership. Some of the most important decisions in human history will be made in the next few days. But it will be I who makes those decisions, not you. You are dismissed.”

“But sir-” Hunt started again.

“I said,” Alekman replied, turning away from Hunt, you are dismissed.”

Hunt let out his breath through his teeth. “Yes, sir.”

He walked out of the room.

!!!

Over on a hill near the southern part of the burning city of Reubon sat a purely inconsequential little house, now a black pile of rubble. Some of the rubble started to stir. Out crawled a large, fluffy dog, fur now ¸covered in ash. The dog walked over to the side of the house, near the emergency basement door, to a limp body lying on the ground.

“Hey, Merlin.” Ardo whispered, not having strength for anything else. Merlin whined softly and nudged Ardo.

“It's... okay, Merlin... I'm okay...” he said. He could no longer feel the broken bones or the blood covering his body. “Just... resting my eyes... that's all.”

Merlin whined and nudged him with his nose again. Ardo closed his eyes and patted his dog softly. Merlin lied down and waited for his master to wake up.

He never did.

!!!

The storm clouds were disappearing now. The skies were clearing. Birds chirped merrily, flying between the trees still standing, heedless of the black smoke billowing out of buildings and houses, or of the battalions of armed aliens or the strange vehicles be driven around, or of the bodies littered all over the ground. The storm was over. But something much worse had begun.
