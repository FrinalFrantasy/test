* An Adoring Question
How many times across the years
Have I looked upon thine face?
Which number, O great multitude
Will answer this, my soul's reprise?

To seek out clue or gentle hint
So there can be no disgrace-
Not disrespect for nose and mouth,
Naught but joy when seen your eyes!

Help me, pray, assist one man
That, assured, he'll rest at night:
What amount of sight is mine
On such profile recondite?
* Crallo Brallo
Crallo Brallo in the sea,
Have you got a goat for me?
Crallo Brallo on the land,
Will you lend a helping hand?
Crallo Brallo in the sky,
How ever did you get so high?
Crallo Brallo in the moon,
Hope you learn to escape soon.
Crallo Brallo in the sun,
I'm afraid it's time to run!
* Jewel
Folded carefully into her brown hair, the green jewel was once the carapace of a flower beetle. It settled in the light from the back door, no longer obscured by the steam of boiling spaghetti-water. Consciously I reached for it, but she was not willing to stay, and I not to restrain. The accident did that to us, made her afraid, and IÅ\who had been drivingÅ\wanted never to feel life struggle in my arms again. After an hour's conversation I looked away from her car pulling from the driveway to that jewel, sitting lifeless and dark on the counter table.
* Killer's Cry
See
The knowing look in your scoundrel eyes
When they alight upon mine.
Glance at the mirror if you don't believe me.
Do not be deceived,
If I have to I will kill,
And likewise you will die.

A knife?
You see in my hands a knife, a sword, a gun,
A wire 'round the neck
A heavy flashlight that caves in the skull.
My hands are bare (though I could yet kill with them)
The police will side with me.

Accusing orbs,
Wretched facsimiles of light,
Turn from me!
There is only one body at your feet,
But it can be joined.

Why do I wait?
How can eyes arrest movement?
I should see your blood across the ground,
Breathing,
Beautiful.
I should
See.

I would take you to my bed,
But you would not come.
I would talk with you at night,
But you would not stay.
I would slit your body from stomach to breast, 'till you screamed,
But for the glazing of your eyes.

My hand is stayed.
I am broken.
I am as those who cry.

There is only one body at your feet,
And it is mine.
