¡§Where were you last night?¡¨ demanded the artist of a disheveled paintbrush. He held it at arm's length, scrutinizing it, then cast it aside and snatched up a palette. ¡§Where were you, palette?¡¨ Growling, he saw that his tubes of paint were all out of order, and mostly empty. ¡§I didn't leave you like that. No no no, no no, violet goes to the left of blue, the left, like in the rainbow. It's a lower wavelength, you are all well aware of that. It's as though¡V as though children got a hold of you. Is that what you want? To be toys? I would hope you would aspire to more than that and no Mr. curator I am not a hack.¡¨

¡§No, I disagree,¡¨ said the curator; ¡§I have been listening to these tirades for the past six months, and I am quite certain that you're a hack. In fact, I have already called for security to escort you out, because I expect you to resist when I say: get out of my gallery.¡¨

The artist whirled around, red-faced and sputtering.

¡§But no, listen, it's not my fault. You can see, look, right¡V look right here, look, this isn't, this¡V this¡V this isn't my doing.¡¨

¡§Nothing is your doing, Mr. Felt. You don't do anything. You just sit in my gallery and waste time, my time and my money, and for this reason I am confident in saying that my life will be a better and fuller one if you get out.¡¨

¡§No, Mr. curator, wait, wait, look at this. Look.¡¨ Mr. Felt¡Vthe artist¡Vleapt over to where his discarded paintbrush lay, but his foot caught on the edge of an easel and he went tumbling to the ground. The easel was large and metal and the canvas on it was also large; it was white at the edges, but the whole front of it was covered in shades of light gray and gray-blue, and the outline of a cabin and a lake and some trees was sketched in pencil very lightly on top.

The artist came up again, his paintbrush shaking in his hand. He thrust it at the curator like he was showing him a dangerous insect that he was afraid to let go of.

¡§Look at this,¡¨ he said, his voice full of urgency and his mouth full of spit. ¡§This brush, look at this.¡¨

¡§OK.¡¨

¡§Do you see this brush?¡§

¡§Yes.¡§

¡§Do you see it?¡¨

¡§Yes, I see¡V ¡§

¡§Do you see this brush?¡¨

¡§Yes I see the brush!¡¨

¡§This¡V this thing¡V this is a good brush. This is an expensive brush. I got this at Edward & Edward's. Number six filbert head. Mongoose hair. This is a good brush. It's supposed to be a good brush. It was a good brush. Now I don't know. OK? I don't know where it was last night. You don't know where it was last night. Do you know why? Because it won't tell us. OK? It used to tell me. Now it won't. I don't know. Where does a paintbrush go at night to have a good time? ¡¨

¡§Oho,¡¨ said the curator, ¡§here are the boys in blue.¡¨ Indeed, two bored-looking police officers had just come through the main door.

¡§Oh, oh, please let me stay, Mr. curator,¡¨ said the artist. ¡§I'm sorry. Just, just give me another month. One more month, I'll come in on weekends too, I'll get it done.¡¨

¡§I've given you another month. Twice I've given you another month. This painting¡V¡§ he poked the canvas¡V¡§was supposed to be finished two months ago. I told you last time that I wouldn't, I cannot possibly push it back again, even if I wanted to. I've got other people willing to fill the spot in this gallery. People with paintings, Mr. Felt. Do you understand that? Finished paintings.¡¨

¡§I'll take it home, though. Look, I'll take it home, I'll finish it.¡¨ The artist tried to lift the metal easel, but it seemed to be fixed to the ground.

¡§That easel doesn't belong to you,¡¨ said the curator.

¡§I could borrow it.¡¨

The curator made a disgusted face, and motioned for the guards to remove the poor man, who was still clutching the easel.

¡§Be thankful the advance portion of your commission was as small as it was, or I would sue you for it. Pleas, go away now.¡¨

¡§Oh, Mr. curator, please,¡¨ said the artist, as the guards dragged him away.

Later, he sat on the sidewalk outside the gallery, and berated it as though he were drunk.

¡§I do not appreciate you, sidewalk. Know why? Because you are not very nice to me. You are hard and uncomfortable and I do not like you one bit.

¡§Oh, and you were hardly a help,¡¨ he said to his bag of art supplies, which had just been thrown out the door, and landed next to him. How am I supposed to paint without paint? Without a paintbrush?¡¨ He seized his paintbrush out of the bag and stared at it violently. ¡§I clean you, you realize. After every time I'm done with you. That's how I know, that's how I know you went out last night. Look at you! Bristles unkempt and dirty. Dried paint clinging to some of them. Have you no shame? Why, that paint's not even all the same color! There's magenta, I mean, rose; there's some kind of dark green, I forget the name; and what's that? Vermilion?¡¨ His fist shook. ¡§Oh, damn you, vermilion!¡¨

Back into the bag the artist threw the prodigal paintbrush, and he didn't bother to close it. He stood up and slung it over his shoulder, where it hung like a lumpy, over-sized purse, or a squat fish with its mouth wide open. All of his art supplies stared up at him, plaintively.

¡§My paints are useless,¡¨ muttered the artist, hailing a taxi. ¡§My pastels are unreliable. My pens can't be trusted to a signature. And my palette knife¡V!¡¨

¡§Oh, cheer up, mate,¡¨ said his soft charcoal pencil, as he climbed into the cab. ¡§I'll always be there for you.¡¨
