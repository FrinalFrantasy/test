There was an old man, on the steps of the palace. He was alone and seemed to be half-asleep where he stood. It was not until the cold, thin wind picked up that he opened his eyes. He breathed deeply, the air stinging in his lungs, and looked into the sky. There were gray clouds coming from the East, bringing rain and hail. Today was the day of a great celebration, and the storm would mean changing plans, cutting ceremonies short so that the people could return to their crops and preserve all that was there. The old man closed his eyes, the one of flesh and the other of glass, and when he opened them again, the clouds were gone. He walked up the stairs and into the palace.

There were no people in the entrance chamber, but the room was filled with music. The music emanated from the auditorium and flowed through the empty hallways, echoing against the walls; it was a sound of emotions, of joy and sadness; it was beauty enough to ease a thousand hearts' worries. So said all who heard the symphony. The old man opened the door to the auditorium half an arm's length and looked in. He was careful not to make any noise, although if he had no one would have noticed. Nobody even saw him, or noticed as the great man peered through the crack in the door and beheld his creation. The music passed over him like water over rock, and although he knew every note and every instant of it, he could still appreciate the work of art that he had created ¡V or rather, had helped to create. It was not truly his. It belonged to the young man sitting in the front row, and to another, who was now conducting. The former was their leader, everyone's leader. He had been elected the day before, and today had been the ceremonies, the new legislatures and the celebrations, culminating in this symphony. It was the symphony of the new order, of a new age of peace.

The old man closed the door softly, and made his way along the corridor that ran parallel to the auditorium. He ran his hand along the wall as he walked, feeling every brick, every stone, every grain of wood. He knew them all, seeing them in his mind, and again he breathed deeply. He felt the music, too, as it passed through the walls and through his wrinkled fingertips. His other hand hung limply at his side. That hand had died long ago, and he had it covered now by a heavy leather glove, to hide the dry black skin. He walked up a spiral staircase leading into one of the private boxes, his tired feet aching with every step. He wanted dearly to simply rest.

The old man finally reached the small balcony, which was empty. He walked slowly to the farthest corner of the the box, and lowered himself gently into a chair. It was the box he had reserved, at the very edge of the auditorium, and though it had a bad view of the stage he could see every other occupant, every single person in the room. He saw the faces of the leader and the council and of all those who were ushering in the new society. It had taken many years to achieve what they had; years of quelling wars and uprising, of ordering chaos and returning hope to the once-barren lands. But now it was done, and they had - peace. And it would not last forever, but it would certainly last a long time.

The old man closed his eyes and inhaled slowly, listening to the music. It was very beautiful.

Dagan had felt it when the symphony had started, and he was now running towards the palace. He could not explain how he knew, but he had felt it in the very core of his being, had run to the old man's house and known even before reaching it that it would be empty. He had known the night before where he would have to go to find the man, but he had not entirely believed it until that moment, and that realization spurred him on to the palace, up the stone stairs and into the entryway. The symphony was in its last movement, and for a moment Dagan stopped, his eyes closed, its beauty and grandeur sweeping over him. He forced himself to move again, and he ran quickly down the hallways, not knowing where to look, his steps echoing through empty rooms. He ran up and down staircases, praying he was not too late, not even positive of what he was afraid of missing. It was a feeling rather than a reason, a feeling that had gnawed and grown within him the whole day, and by the time he acted he could feel nothing else but this driving emotion.

Dagan wrenched open a door and ran up a spiral staircase, two steps at a time, and when he got to the top he saw ¡V the man. He was simply sitting there, listening to the symphony. For a moment Dagan thought he saw a wreath of light around the man, shining from him, but then it was gone. He was simply a very old man, peacefully enjoying the symphony.

Dagan spoke the man's name. The old man turned, and smiled.

¡§Friend,¡¨ he said, ¡§I wondered if I would see you today.¡¨

¡§Hello,¡¨ Dagan said, simply. He had thought he knew exactly what he was going to say, but now he couldn't seem to form the words. He sat down in the chair next to the old man, and watched the orchestra for a moment. The many violinists, the percussionists with their kettle drums. . .

¡§I thought I'd find you here.¡¨ Dagan said, keeping his eyes on the orchestra. ¡§But I thought you would come for the inauguration.¡¨

¡§I wanted to hear the symphony as it was meant to be played. That is all there is left for me.¡¨

¡§The government won't be perfect. We will still need your - guidance.¡¨

¡§I have done all that there was for me to do.¡¨

¡§Yes! Yes, you have! You have given us everything that you had, even when you had to destroy your own body! Why can't you spend your last years in rest? Why can't you allow yourself even that much?¡¨

Years ago Dagan had met a young, strong man who had an unrivaled desire to give, to help in every way that he could. He had spoken grandly and excitedly of the society that they could have, he had helped build houses, feed the poor, care for the sick, he had smiled and laughed, and now. . . Now there sat before Dagan a man who was old before his time. Dagan thought of the way the man's body had died and decayed so quickly; he looked at the man, seeing the frail skin, the glass eye, the leather glove. And he felt terrible. Never had the man put himself before any other person, never had he accepted even the barest of rewards for his work.

¡§You are sad,¡¨ said the old man, ¡§because you think of me as a man. You think that because of what I have done, because of my weariness, I am not at peace. Friend, I tell you, I am at peace. I have fulfilled my purpose.¡¨

Dagan was silent for a long time, trying to ease the constriction he felt in his throat. He listened to the symphony, and let it soothe him.

¡§You created this,¡¨ Dagan said.

¡§Created? No, I could never create anything. I could only ever destroy.¡¨

¡§You remember the first uprising, don't you? At the state council. They killed the guards and held a sword to the throat of every man in that room, but you spoke to them, and they surrendered.¡¨

¡§I told them nothing they could not hear from anyone else.¡¨

¡§You spoke to the boy, also, the one who fell down the well and broke his leg. He screamed and cried and would not listen to anybody when they told him to take hold of the rope, not even his parents. Yet when you spoke to him, and your eyes met, he was calm.¡¨

¡§He was young.¡¨ The old man smiled.

¡§And the candle?¡¨

¡§You are referring to incident on the ship that brought us our library?¡¨

¡§Yes. I remember that most clearly of all. While they repaired the mast's line I spoke to the guard who had left the room that held the books, and he told me he had set his candle down on the floor in his haste, but that he was not worried because it was in a puddle of water. How could there have been water in that room? I was the one who realized what had happened, that if the guard had stopped to check he would've seen that a lamp had broken and its oil had leaked onto the floor. I ran to the hold, expecting every book in the room to be destroyed, but the candle had burned itself out. I came into the room and saw nothing but a thin disk of wax in a pool of oil.¡¨

¡§I heard of that, yes. Do you hold me accountable for good fortune?¡¨

Dagan shook his head. ¡§There was no fortune. It would be easier to stand a sword on its point than balance a candle upright on a ship, when there is a high wind and one of the mast's lines is broken. You did that.¡¨

The old man was silent for a moment. He lifted his leather gauntlet with his good hand and considered it. ¡§It is not difficult to remove the fear from a child,¡¨ he said, ¡§or even the hatred from an insurgent. The fire I merely held in my mind, and it was gone.¡¨

¡§And that was the day your eye began to dim,¡¨ Dagan said.

¡§My medium is death, Dagan!¡¨ the old man said, meeting his gaze. ¡§I am no stranger to it! Everything I have done for you, for your people, I have done by destruction.¡¨

¡§Would you deny that the statue maker is an artist, because he can only remove from the stone, but never add?¡¨

¡§To carve the stone is to use the gifts that God has given you. To create the stone. . . Only God can do that.¡¨

¡§And you are not a god?¡¨

The old man laughed shortly. ¡§Do I look like a god? No, I do not think so; gods do not die.¡¨

Dagan took a deep breath. ¡§It was my purpose to protect you-¡¨

¡§It was your charge,¡¨ said the old man, ¡§and of that charge you are now released.¡¨

¡§But do you have to die? Now? Can't you stay a little longer, even if you are weak. . .¡¨

¡§Dagan,¡¨ said the old man, ¡§tell me what you hear.¡¨

Dagan listened. The symphony was very quiet now, but he could hear it. He could hear the beating of his heart. And, what else?

Dagan suddenly felt cold. He spoke the old man's name again, and then,

¡§Why aren't you breathing?¡¨

The old man did not look at him. ¡§I stopped breathing shortly after you arrived.¡¨

Dagan was shaking, his own breath coming in large gasps as though he could breath for both of them. He tried to speak, but the words caught in his throat.

¡§There is only one true sadness I have felt in my time.¡¨ said the old man. ¡§And that is to not be able to enjoy art. Anything I hold in my mind, anything I truly imagine is destroyed, and becomes lost. So I came here, I came to hear the symphony and know that my work was done. When I saw you, I knew that it was, so I did the one thing I have always longed but never dared to do, and I imagined myself.¡¨ He shuddered, as though the old body were giving up the last of its life. ¡§I held in my mind myself, my purpose, my life. I am dead now, my power is gone, and I am free to listen, and to feel.¡¨

The symphony was almost at its end now. Dagan was quiet for a long time before he was able to speak.

¡§What about them?¡¨ Dagan gestured to all the people in the auditorium. ¡§Will they remember you?¡¨

¡§They will be fine. They may remember me, but history will not, because it is not my purpose to be remembered.¡¨

¡§Your purpose. . .¡¨

¡§My purpose was to help. I was sent as a man, and I am a man, in all ways but one: there is no greed in me.¡¨

¡§That's why you could destroy,¡¨ Dagan said, and the old man nodded.

They fell into silence. The symphony ended to a great, tumultuous applause. The crowd stood, and the conductor bowed. The leader climbed onto the stage and shook the conductor's hand, and then embraced him, for they were friends. The musicians, too, were shaking each other's hands. The applause was almost deafening. Over it Dagan said loudly, ¡§What will happen to you now?¡¨

He turned, wondering if the old man had heard him, but all that he saw in the seat beside him was the leather glove.
