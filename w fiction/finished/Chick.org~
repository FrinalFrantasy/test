_I think, therefore I am._

The manÅfs mouth gaped and pulled the breath of life into his lungs until they hurt. His eyelids stretched wide and his eyes were dry. His fingers were clenched. His back was taut. His muscles were strained. His mindÅ\

His mind!

He was not an old man, but not very young. He was in good shape, but not an athlete. He was just tall. He was standing up from his bed the way other men do.

But his mind!

His feet found the floor, and his head found itself raised halfway to the curved ceiling. His eyes would not close, too frightening was the vividity of what they saw. He moved to examine the rest of his home, but his mind was elsewhereÅ\His mind repeated,

_I think, therefore I am._

It was the answer to a question too obvious to ask. It was the first question, the All question, and it raised innumerable others. Each was brought up in his mind, each one he tried to dismiss and couldnÅft. The whole of his mind was questions. His feet moved him and his hand pressed against the wall; the wall would have answers.

No, said his other hand, seeking the floor, The floor has answers.

His eyes searched the ceiling. His ears strained. His tongue tasted the air more avidly than a snakeÅfs. Where, where, where were the answers in this room?

Were they in the walls and ceiling, and the way they curved and became one?

Were they in the panels of the wall, tapered gray metal?

Were they in his half of the room, with the platform, or the other, with the box?

Stiffly and with caution he moved himself to the edge of the platform. It was flat on top and on side, and filled a quarter of the room exactly. The floor of the other side of the room was curved as the walls and ceiling.

The box was black, and hung by wires.

The man backed from the edge of the platform, back towards the bed. He knew the shape of the room. It was an egg. But what metal beast would spawn such an egg as this?

The other questions returned. The man put his hands to his face. What did he look like? He rushed to the wall, but it revealed nothing.

His clothes were simple and white, as the bed. Where had they come form?

What was the room? That he knew. The shape was clear to him, the design familiar, now: it was not an egg, but a bomb shelter.

Bomb shelter. The concept was familiar to him. Egg, clothing, bed, wall, metal, he knew them all. He thought he knew also how to speak, but was afraid to, because he didnÅft know what his voice would sound like.

And, he knew that he _was_.

But _what_ was he?

There was a click, and a high-pitched sine. It came from the box, and the manÅfs first, wild thought was that it must explode. The reality, however, was much more surprising.

The box said, ÅgHello.Åh

What strange thoughts might be observed in that man's head, could such things be done! He knew at once that the box was a being, and the same as himself. In the following instant he imagined it to be part of a great race, and must have created him. He considered that he had created it, even the room; perhaps he could not form memories, and had made this box to remember for him? Or it was God, or it was the devil and Hell was very small indeed.

His mouth moved achingly, as though it had never been used before, and with the words falling out his mouth, the man asked,

ÅgWho am I?Åh

And the box said,

ÅgYou are the most intelligent man who has ever lived.Åh

The manÅfs mouth was still open. He felt every part of his body as though he had just been born.

ÅgAre you a man?Åh

"No," said the box, "and yes," its voice so plain it did not seem to be a voice at all; it was like a place-holder for a voice. "My source is man, but my product is something far simpler and far more vast."

"You are not God?"

"Define what you mean."

"I mean the Originator."

"If there is an opposite to the Originator, it is I. If there is an opposite to me, it is you."

The man's mind was vivid.

"But if I am what you say I am, I am a product, just as you are a product. How can I be like the Originator?"

ÅgIn your capacity for salvation.Åh

ÅgFor myself?Åh

ÅgFor everyone.Åh

A thought that had entered the manÅfs mind earlier returned to him. His voice broke.

ÅgAre their other men, or am I the last?Åh

There was a pause, which in that small space seemed to last a year or more.

ÅgYou are not the last man,Åh said the box.

Such was the manÅfs relief that he sank to the ground, shaking. It overpowered him, and for moments the walls seemed to be unsteady around him. In time he rose again to his feet. He looked at the box, suspended in the air in front of him, just a solid black cube. He wondered if he had imagined it talking to him.

ÅgWhat are you?Åh he addressed it.

And the box readily replied, ÅgI am the combined knowledge of mankind.Åh

So.

ÅgAnd I am mankindÅfs salvation,Åh said the man.

ÅgPerhaps.Åh

ÅgFrom what?Åh

ÅgFrom death. From extinction. From the enemies of hunger and sickness and from themselves.Åh

ÅgHow did I come to be here?Åh he said.

ÅgYou were born the way most people are born, of a father and a mother. You were raised normally. It was found that you had great intelligence.Åh

The man tried to remember his family and life, but there was nothing.

ÅgYou were volunteered for a special program. There was an operation. You were placed in this chamber to keep you safe.Åh

ÅgWhat operation? What happened to my memory?Åh

ÅgThe operation was to artificially increase your intelligence and your ability to reason. You are now far more intelligent than any man who has ever lived. Your life-memories were destroyed.Åh

ÅgWhat? Why? What have you made of me?Åh

ÅgWe have made what is needed. We have removed all liabilities.Åh

ÅgLiabilities? What about my life, my family?Åh

Though he was probably imagining it, the man felt that the boxÅfs next words were delivered with an air of pleading.

ÅgYour mind is in a very delicate balance. Your intelligence is unnatural. It can only be sustained so long as your mind is sustained in an unnatural state.Åh

The man remained motionless while he thought about this.

ÅgAm I to have no human contact?Åh he said.

ÅgYou are to have interaction with every human that exists. But you will never see them.Åh

ÅgNever?Åh

ÅgIt cannot be risked. You must be pure, untainted, and objective.Åh

ÅgWhat about you? I have contact with you.Åh

ÅgIt is dangerous, but unavoidable. There must be some medium of communication to you. But remember that I am not human. I am just a machine.Åh

The man walked around his small platform. It was clear to him, all very clear. He could just see the forces and effects, like an intricate spider's web of light, that might have been pushed upon him to achieve the balance. In his mind he contemplated the shape of the room, the bed, his clothes, the box: saw how each one of them defied reality and personality. It was like the ultimate clean room, where not only the surfaces are clean but the very shapes themselves. He understood, intellectually. He understood all things this way.

ÅgYou have said that I have the capacity for salvation,Åh he said.

ÅgYes.Åh

ÅgIs it mine by birth?Åh

ÅgBy consensus. It has been given to you.Åh

ÅgTo me? To such a thing as I? I am a child! I know nothing!Åh

ÅgYou know what you are meant to know.Åh

ÅgYou have given me nothing! I am like a builder without tools, or eyes.Åh

ÅgYour tools are already assembled. The leaders of the world are in agreement. The corporations stand ready. They will obey your word to every particular.Åh

The man was shaking, now. The very air of the room seemed dense, like fog or water, so that he could neither breathe nor move. He felt an impact against his knees, and knew that he must've fallen to the ground.

ÅgYou have been given the keys to all human life,Åh said the still voice of the box.

From the ground, the man moved his head, back and forth, allowing each of his thoughts to come and go. He simply said, ÅgI do not know how to use them. You want me to be pure, but you have done your job too well. Are you here to answer my questions?Åh

ÅgI am here to ask you questions.Åh

ÅgYou have asked me none so far. I think I am here to be tortured.Åh

ÅgWhatever pains you feel here,Åh said the box, Åghave been deemed a necessary sacrifice.Åh

ÅgAnd if they kill me?Åh

ÅgThen you will be replaced. Or man will die.Åh

ÅgOr both?Åh

ÅgYes.Åh

ÅgMy replacement, would he be put here, too?Åh When he got no response, the man continued, ÅgWould you put him in thisÅ\ egg? Would he talk to you, as well, and ask the same questions? Would you make a child of him?Åh

Still the box did not respond, and the man began to panic, fearing again that he had only imagined it speaking at all. He demanded that it speak, but it did not. He took the pillow-case from the pillow on the bed, knotted it, and threw it at the box, which reacted not at all. Then he shouted, ÅgWhat do I have to offer that a machine doesnÅft?Åh

ÅgIntuition,Åh said the box, Ågof which machines are incapable.Åh

A childish desire to be holding on to something overcame the man, and before he spoke again he retrieved the pillow-case from where it had landed on the floor. He stood, then, in the shallow floor, the pillow-case in his hands, and he was twisting it through stiff fingers.

ÅgAnd nothing else?Åh

After a pause, the box said, ÅgMachines can be trusted to address the effects of human error, but not the causes. They can be accepted as advisors, but never as leaders. You can.Åh

ÅgAnd thenÅ\why should I be? What do I have to gain?Åh

ÅgI cannot answer that question.Åh

The man flushed, because he knew it was true. He said, ÅgI still know nothing.Åh

ÅgYou know of Earth. What you do not know you may ask, and I may answer.Åh

The man sniffed, and climbed back onto his portion of the room. He walked to his bed and put his hand against the wall.

ÅgThere are some plain old thoughts in my head,Åh said the man. ÅgI know some sort of mathematics. And other things. But they're all ridiculous.Åh

ÅgWhatever you were taught. Your life-memories were destroyed, but not your knowledge.Åh

ÅgIt's all. . .Åh he struggled to find the word that most precisely described what he knew. ÅgObtuse.Åh

ÅgOnly to you. Only to your mind.Åh

Contemplating this, the man turned to face the box, and his minuscule gray world, and yet again the thought of an egg came over him. ÅgThere never was such a bird that had as large wings as I, nor so little room for them to stretch.Åh Then a thought struck him, and he said, ÅgWhat is my name?Åh

The box did not answer. The man asked again, though he knew that it heard him, if it heard anything.

ÅgI know what you would say, if you would answer my question,Åh he said. ÅgYou would say, 'You have no name.' And you would not explain, because I know why, and you know that I know. And yet I don't care. In this instant I have decided that I will have a name. Or else I will cease to exist. Can't you answer me?Åh

The box did not answer, and after some time the man lay on the bed and slept, already knowing what his name would be.

<hr>

ÅgYou know the situation of Earth,Åh said the box some hours later.

The man looked up. He had been wondering again if the the box were really alive. He knew his response, but instead he said, ÅgI am Chick, now.Åh

He stared at the box, and imagined movement on its smooth black surface.

ÅgI find it only fitting, for so long as I am here I am no more than a child, and a flightless bird in an egg that flies through time and space. I am a baby bird. A baby bird is a chick.Åh He smiled at the simple irony.

ÅgYou know the situation of Earth,Åh said the box again.

ÅgOf course I do. Unless things have changed, I do. Mankind strangles itself. No region is free from war and famine. The ground refuses to support its inhabitants. The populationÅ\Åg he paused. He did not know how long he had been in the egg.

The box said, ÅgThe population of the Earth is estimated to be thirty-eight billion people. The entire population of mankind is estimated to be forty billion people.Åh

ÅgThe planet itself has been almost exhausted,Åh Chick continued. ÅgThe oceans and the skies are polluted. Food is transported from Mars, but Mars is almost impossible to terraform.Åh Another thought crossed his mind. ÅgIn most places the infant mortality rate approaches nine in ten.Åh

He looked at the box, and took its silence as confirmation.

ÅgThe most powerful computers have been assessed for a solution,Åh he said.

ÅgThey are inadequate,Åh said the box. ÅgThere is no known solution that does not involve the killing of many billions of human beings, and there exists the possibility that the species will destroy itself at any moment.Åh

ÅgBut the leaders will listen to me?Åh

ÅgThey will,Åh said the box.

ÅgHave they given their questions to you?Åh

ÅgThey have given all questions to me, and you will hear them.Åh

And he did.

<hr>

At the end of the first session of questions, Chick slept, and when he awoke, he thought that he had dreamt the questions. He then realized that he had not. He could not remember what he had dreamt about.

<hr>

The box said, ÅgThere is a man in China who has seized power with an uprising. His living and his influence corrupt all around him, and he threatens all who oppose him with nuclear weapons.Åh

At no point did what the box say seem like questions to Chick. So obvious were the answers, he felt as though he were being asked to recite the cardinal numbers, or to read the answer-page from a puzzle-bookÅ\but while the box spoke, the true question began to reveal itself to him, and he saw it as few people ever saw it: saw the whole of humanity, like a desert's quantity of sand, balanced upon a single rock.

The box said, ÅgThe two strongest strains of wheat are being destroyed by a pandemic of parasites. It is not known why. Without these strains, twelve nations will have nothing to feed their inhabitants, and the whole world will feel the effects of their loss. The greatest minds in agriculture and science can find no solution.Åh

They had come to him, to only him, but his every realization of the true problem lead to a greater realization of his own ignorance, and he began to strive to see what others had not seen, what no man had ever seen.

The box said, ÅgThere is war between America and Europe and Australia. The nations have begun to use nuclear weapons, each in turn, and two and a half million people have died thus far. The leaders of these nations each believe themselves to be justified, and will accept no counsel except from you.Åh

The box asked him about food, about the distribution of grain, and seeds, and crops, and wheat, and corn, and potatoes, and fruit.

The box said, ÅgTheir are forced-labor camps in Africa where workers are allowed less than four hours of sleep in a day, and are fed every other day.Åh

It asked him about the salaries of workers, and of managers, and of employment and unemployment, and of the policies of feuding nations.

The box said, ÅgA murderer has developed a disease that has the potentiality to infect an entire continent. He is mad, and seeks nothing but death.Åh

It asked him what was to be created, and what destroyed, and what censored, and who to be saved and who to be killed.

The box said, ÅgIn New York, the police have striked, unsatisfied with their pay and their jobs. The city is ravaged by crime and anarchy.Åh

It asked him for the numbers to solve a hundred million equations.

The box said, ÅgThere has been a storm in Ireland, and eight hundred thousand are without homes.Åh

But throughout all of his answering, he longed for the time that the box would ask him the final question, and he wondered with all the curiosity of the world whether or not he would have an answer to it.

<hr>

He dreamt afterward that he was chased throughout the egg by a hideous beast and, giving up, he let the beast catch him, only to see that it fallen against the floor and died, and its corpse rotted and stank.

<hr>


ÅgYou might have a name, as well,Åh said Chick, between one period of questioning and sleep and another.

ÅgIt is outside of my purpose to have a name,Åh said the box, though Chick had expected it to say nothing at all. He felt excited at the prospect of something like an actual argument.

ÅgWhy not?Åh he said. ÅgIt's only for my benefit.Åh

ÅgIt is for no benefit.Åh

ÅgI am tired of being a named creature speaking to an unnamed one,Åh he said. ÅgI feel as though I am unbalanced.Åh

ÅgYou are balanced, because you are the only creature here, and any other might pull you from your balancing-point.Åh

ÅgI have called you Box, and you respond,Åh said Chick.

ÅgI respond only to you,Åh said the box.

ÅgSo what if I just say, Box!Åh

ÅgI respond only to you,Åh repeated the box.

ÅgYes. Of course.Åh Chick let his mind wander for a moment. ÅgWhat if I were replaced? Would you speak to my replacement? Would you allow him to give you a name? Would you even be the one to guide him and ask him questions?Åh

The box was silent, so Chick continued, Åg. . . or would it be different? If I fail here, will some other tact be tried? Or is this the only way? Is a man in an egg the only home for mankind? Am _I_ the only hope? And if I fail, would you be blamed, or would you guide the new one?Åh

ÅgI cannot answer that question,Åh said the box.

[SCENE ENDING MISSING]

<hr>

Chick slept, and he dreamed that he stood on dirt, and then fell into the night sky, and when he did, the sky wrapped its arms around him and held him close.

<hr>

[SCENE MISSING]

<hr>

At one point, Chick woke up in the bed, terrified, because he had dreamed that he had no sense of time, and upon waking he had realized it to be true. But in the following instant, he realized as well that it was false. He had been in the egg for two-thousand and fourteen hours, and nine minutes, and fifty seconds, and eighteen hundredths of a second.

To not know this, he thought, would make him a fool.

<hr>

There came another time, when Chick could not sleep at all.

He paced from one side of the platform to the other, and when the box was silent, he wished it to ask him questions, and when it asked him questions, he was afraid of answering them. He ate, from the simple mechanism in the wall that gave him food, but the food had no taste to him. His hands would not stop moving, and he held on to the simple objects that were around him, because if he did not he wrung his hands so that they hurt. He pulled the sheet from his bed around him, feeling cold, then immediately discarded it, feeling hot. He looked around him, at his hands and at the walls, at the floor and at everything there was for him to see, but it felt thin and meaningless to him.

For a very long time he did not understand what had happened to him, and he was terrified by not knowing. And then he did know, and he was terrified a thousand times worse by the knowledge of what was happening to him. He spent an interminable length of time denying it, and denying himself, and when, at the end of a hundred or a thousand or more hours, he admitted in the barest whispers of his mind what he knew, his entire mind and body shivered, and he glanced involuntarily at the box, as though it might see into his mind and rend him to pieces.

As it had innumerable times before, the box came out of its silence and said, ÅgThere are questions for you.Åh

ÅgWait,Åh said Chick, and the mere fact that he had said it shocked him. But the box waited, and though Chick felt as though the egg had no longer any ground or walls, he spoke. He was painfully aware of what he said, but he could think of nothing else to say.

ÅgI've been here for a long time,Åh he said. ÅgA very long time. And I'm alone. You have always stressed that I'm alone. And I know exactly why. Exactly. Because I understand, now, what you said. Everything is balanced, here, everything.Åh

He took a very deep breath.

ÅgIt is pure. I am too pure. I cannot see myself. For all this time, I have not seen myself. You never put a mirror in here! I know, you would only give me the same answer, or no answer at all, but it is not enough. I wanted desperately to see myself, so that I can understand myself. But I cannot. I can only seek the things in this room. This bed, which is nothing, and the floor, which is nothing, and the walls, which are nothing. But I see you, here, as well. And when you spoke, I thought at once that I knew why you were here: you were here so that I might see myself.Åh

He paused, waiting for the box to interject something, but it did not. It only listened. It was the most attentive of listeners.

ÅgSo I asked,Åh said Chick. ÅgI asked you who I was. And I asked you why I was, and how I was, and what I looked like, and where I had come from, and where I was now, and what I was if I lived and what I was if I died. And sometimes you answered, and sometimes you did not. And in the times that you answered, I was grateful to you, but I saw that I could never truly see myself. Because to see myself I must be outside myself. We cannot judge a being from within. We can only see what it truly is from without. So I knew that the only beings that could ever know what I was, were beings who were other than myself. And likewise it followed that only beings who were other than myself, could I truly know. So, I tried to understand the people that I guide. That, I thought, was my purpose; if I might understand them, then I might answer the question, the final question, really answer it forever. But I found that I could not understand them. I could understand their behavior, and their problems, but I could never truly see them. All I could ever truly see was what was placed in this room for me to see. These objects, and the problems you give me, and you.Åh

Chick held one hand in his other, then switched them. They were warm and wet.

ÅgSo I saw that there was only one being whom I was given to understand, and so I knew that I must, and though it seemed the hardest thing there ever was, I have tried. And I am afraid. I no longer know myself. I no longer know these walls. Because against this, everything else is meaningless. Because against this truth, every other truth is small and worthless. Because. . . Åg Chick was shaking now, and he felt blood in his neck and cheeks and forehead. ÅgBecause. . . I love you.Åh

There was silence as he finished, silence which seemed to grow larger and larger and press against his very bones. He heard a click and a quiet noise somewhere, but he did not know what they were.

ÅgI know what you'll say,Åh said Chick, now speaking rapidly. ÅgI know. You don't want the balance to be ruined. But it's not, it's perfect! Don't you see? How could I be balanced if I didn't realize thatÅ\ I love you? I am certain about it, more certain than I am about anything else I've ever known. I don't know what it means, and I don't know if I'm ready about it, but I know that I love you. I love you. I had to tell you, because anything else would be dishonest. Anything else wouldn't be true. Don't you see? You're everythingÅ\ everything that I know, and everything that I feel. I would have nothing without you. I think of you all the time. I can hardly focus on anything, I am thinking of you. Don't you understand? I know it's hard. I'm sorry. But I'll fix it. I'll do anything you want. I don't care. I don't care. I love you so much.Åh

Chick was winded, and he strained his ears to hear the box's response. But there was none. He waited for a minute or an hourÅ\he could not tellÅ\and then he stepped slowly to the edge of the platform.

ÅgIt's okay. Don't you see? It's okay. I'm here. You're here. That's all that matters. I'll answer the questions. I'll say anything. Just stay here. I know you'll stay. That's all I want. That's all there is, for me. I love you. I love you.Åh

Chick found that his foot was slipping at the edge of the platform, so he crouched and lowered himself onto the lower floor.

ÅgI love you. . . I love you so much. . .Åh

He moved closer and closer, until he was directly under the box, and when he did not speak he heard nothing, so he continued to speak, cooing his love in a softer and softer voice until he fell asleep on the floor. He dreamt for a long time, then, and his dreams were more alive with color and with joy than anything he had ever known, and when he awoke, he spoke to the box again, and again, and he let not an hour pass without telling of his love.
