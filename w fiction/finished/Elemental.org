No, it was not enough, it was never enough to say merely that Pledge was a man who was a good conversationalist. To do so is to place him in some tier of the interminable hierarchy of all the wearying raconteurs, the public and private speakers, the sharp and the dull humorists, the hosts and the guests and the guests of honor of the social world. It was better to say that he was a conversationalist who was also a good manÅ\and in this case, merely a good man, as one often meets those who are merely good artists or merely good businessmen. PledgeÅfs manhood, his very humanity, it seemed, as real and as basic a foreground it made to his life, was secondary to his tongue; it was a state that escaped the notice of all but the most insightful of listeners, and even they did not know precisely what to make of it. Stranger than the old stubborn who will not change his ways for any reason, Pledge might change his ways for any reason, and yet be none the different for it.

Even if he was not a raconteur, quite, not a humorist, precisely, and not a guest of honor, by whatever margin, he was requested (and willing) to fill these positions quite frequently. It was not clear what he did to support himself. In fact it was more than likely that he did not work at all; taking into account the food he was served at the many dinner-parties he attended, the services offered to him in exchange for giving speeches, the favors accumulated by the solving of any number of minor disputes, it was probable that he had long outgrown the need for any money. He had no family, no friends who seemed to know him on his own level (and not as a listener knows a speaker), and no apparent interest in material goods aside from a clean suit and a black pocket-notebook.

But against this stark minimalism, he was indeed a good guest and a fine person to talk to. As often as he frequented the circles of conversation at any given party, it was never as often as the circles themselves frequented him, pulled him away from each other, or came apart or together, only for the purpose of including him.

This is how Pledge lived, and this is how he was that night.

ÅgNow, now,Åh said Mr. Alfred, when a pause in his laughter would allow it, ÅgIt canÅft have really been as bad as all that, can it? I know, I know, you were with Mr. Jones when it happened, but IÅfve met him before, and for HeavenÅfs sake, I canÅft imagine him saying that to a public figure. HeÅfs not the smartest man youÅfll meet, IÅfll admit it, but he knows when to close his mouth!Åh Mr. Alfred was the host of the dinner-party, and the most good-natured attendant besides. It was his firm belief that any misdeed committed by a man must be the result either of drink, madness, misunderstanding, or love, but never of malice.

ÅgItÅfs hardly for me to pass judgment!Åh said Pledge. ÅgAlthough if I were pressed, I admit I should find some obscure words by which to extol the manÅfs actions, so that by the time their true meanings were discovered I had long deserted the scene. Except, of course, for Mr. JonesÅfs proclivity towards humorÅ\this I salute without hesitation, considering that it is so great that he seems to have abandoned all for the chance to become, himself, an excellent joke.Åh

There was another period of laughter following this remark, and this time it was Mr. Bates who found his voice first:

ÅgBut this is a thing I can believe. If no other! I have said before that it is Mr. JonesÅfs prime goal in life to make a fool of himself, and that nothing will stop him from it. Oh, the poor fellow!Åh And there was laughter again.

Pledge rejoined, ÅgPoor, yes! Indeed I wonder that if the butcher and apothecary traded their wares for wit, Mr. Jones might find enough in himself to purchase a pound of beef from one or a stomach medicine from the other, but never both at once. And there would he be trapped.Åh

Interjected Mr. Bates before the laughter could resume, ÅgYes, yes! And quite unable to escape.Åh

Mr. Bates had it fixed in his mind that he and Pledge were really contemporaries, equals in the telling of anecdotes and comrades in the appreciation of them, yet if he were strictly honest with himself it was not so much the part of a brother-in-arms that he played to Pledge, but something more like an adoring student to a great teacher. Were he possessed of anything like the philological breadth of vision of his icon, he might have noticed how the greatest of conversationists and entertainers maintain a careful balance of agreement and dissent, subject to the ebb and eddies of a given social situationÅ\but that, when facing words with Pledge, his business seemed only to be to agree with him.

ÅgAh, Pledge!Åh said a new voice. Mr. Verdot, addressing him from without the circle of gentlemen, was a fat and powerfully-built man. ÅgPledge, my good boy, IÅfve been looking for you. IÅfve just been discussing the situation with the new tenements down in Greensfield with the young senator here, and I told him what you said to me during the conference last week, and he wants to hear it from you himself.Åh

ÅgSenator Murdoch?Åh said Pledge, quite eager to abandon one conversation for another. ÅgWhy, I didnÅft know he was here, or I would have spoken with him already.Åh

ÅgCome on, heÅfs just over here.Åh And the fat Mr. Verdot waddled through the crowd.

That Mr. Verdot would be agreeable to the notion of consorting with Senator Murdoch might be surprising to anyone who knew the former, but only if they did not know him particularly well. Mr. Verdot had, himself, ran for the office of senatorÅ\had run six times in fact, losing by a larger margin each time, and never failing to enjoy the experience. It was unclear whether he would make of himself, as a public figure, anything other than an ass; but as he had never taken the office, he remained the regular type of ass, who is enjoyable to be near, if not to be around.

As they walked, Pledge got out his black pocket-notebook and made some cursory entries into it. He did this until they were joined by Mrs. Wichter, widow of the late Bernard Wichter, whose financial success had long ago propelled her to the upper classes, a state which she had enjoyed immensely while Mr. Wichter was alive, and, after a suitable period of mourning, went on enjoying after his death. She was middle-aged now, wearing an extravagant orange-and-red dress which she had had made specially for her. She spoke to Pledge, who immediately stopped to speak with her; Mr. Verdot took a few moments to notice that he had somehow lost his companion, and so doubled back to rejoin them.

ÅgMr. Pledge,Åh said Mrs. Wichter, all smiles and teeth, ÅgYou should know better than to come to one of my parties and not say hello to me.Åh

Pledge matched her smile. ÅgMrs. Wichter! I assure you I was on my way to find you even at this very moment.Åh He took her hand and kissed it, old-fashioned, dramatic; Mrs. Wichter only smiled wider. ÅgBut I didn't know this was one of your parties. I thought the gracious Mr. Alfred was our host.Åh

ÅgHe may be the host, but I was the one who put the idea for this party into his head, so that makes it my party. Goodness knows he'd have trouble getting the idea there in the first place.Åh

ÅgWhy, Miss! Are you still holding your grudge against the poor man for that mistake about the Renford deal? Surely, 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.'Åh

Mrs. Wichter's laugh was thin and tinkling.

ÅgI don't hold a grudge against the manÅ\oh, what silly things you say, PledgeÅ\but now I simply know that one can't be too careful about entrusting important affairs to his judgment. And I'm not ashamed to say so, whether it be about his ability to manage financial affairs, or his ability to propose a simple dinner-party.Åh

ÅgI did hear something about that,Åh said Pledge. ÅgIt was suggested that he had made some comment about your late husband which, in such civilized company as was present, might have been seen as particularly injudicious.Åh Pledge shook his head and smiled in a grim way. ÅgBut it canÅft have really been as bad as all that, can it? I know, I know, you were with him when it happened, but IÅfve met him before, and I canÅft imagine him saying that to a public audience. HeÅfs not the smartest man youÅfll meet, IÅfll admit it, but he knows when to close his mouth!Åh

ÅgHeaven knows he ought to!Åh said Mrs. Wichter, in a voice that was deliciously sour. ÅgAnd yet he says these things. I cannot account for it. I wonder if even you can, Pledge, what with your ability to use words so.Åh

Pledge laughed, his jollity quite readily returned to him. ÅgAh! What a poor fellow I am that you should say such kind things to me. No, no, Mrs. Wichter, I shall not marry you for your wealth, no matter how you do pester me.Åh

Mrs. Wichter burst into laughter, and had to calm herself before she could speak properly. ÅgPledge! What a terrible thing to say! You shall kill me with laughter. I am the last person you would want to marryÅ\keeping you from your parties with my books and things, and I would probably drive you mad with my worrying. No, you want a young woman, yes, and someone with a lot of charm and energy; like you, Pledge. If you are interested, in fact, I might mention a few names, though how you have gone this long without being caught up by some fine young dear already is a great mystery to me.Åh

ÅgI would be lying if I said it had never crossed my mind. And yetÅ\ no, no, it would never do. I am far too interested in all people, whatever their gender, to ever be so interested in just one.Åh

ÅgYou do say such strange things, Pledge.Åh

ÅgWhy, I make it my business to say strange things,Åh said Pledge, and he kissed her hand again before he was led off by Mr. Verdot.

ÅgYou know, Pledge,Åh said Mr. Verdot, Ågyou are a man after my own heart. Never married! Oh, it's alright for some, I suppose, but myself, I could never see the point in it. Can't be tied down, aye? A man wants to move around, stay out late at night. Ah! Here's the senator.Åh

Senator Murdoch was alone, sipping his drink, apparently waiting for Mr. Verdot to return with his quarry. Pledge spoke almost the instant the senator noticed them approaching.

ÅgSenator Murdoch, it is a pleasure to meet you. Let me be neither the first nor the last to congratulate you on your election! And they say you are the third-youngest man to be made a senator here in over a hundred years.

ÅgSecond-youngest, and I thank you,Åh said the young senator.

ÅgGenius, the boyÅfs a genius, I tell you,Åh said Mr. Verdot, happily. ÅgDid in two years what took me twelve to find out I couldnÅft. Ha! But IÅfm distracting myself. Go on, Pledge, and tell the senator what you think of the tenement situation.Åh

ÅgOh, but surely the senator does not make it his habit to attend an evening social only to find that all the talk is of work.Åh

ÅgOn the contrary,Åh said the young senator, ÅgI am not so old that I have already grown sick of politics.Åh

ÅgAnd yet not so young that they do not hold your attention?Åh asked Pledge, beaming.

ÅgNo. Not quite.Åh

ÅgYou are quite the man for the job, then. You must tell me, what is your opinion of your predecessor, Mr. Lanning? I have heard it said that you have nothing but respect for the man, even more respect than many of his friends.Åh

Senator Murdoch nodded. ÅgI do. He's a fine man. He was a fine senator.Åh

ÅgAnd yet you ran against him?Åh

ÅgI did.Åh The young senator contemplated his drink for a moment, choosing his next words. ÅgWhen I ran for senator, Mr. PledgeÅ\ or, I'm sorry, you just go by Pledge, yes?Åh

ÅgJust Pledge is fine, yes.Åh

ÅgWell, when I ran for senator, you must understand that I did so not because I saw a problem with the way that things are, but because I saw that there might be a problem with the way things are going to be. I work for the whole, you understand, not for the part, and I workÅ\that is to say, I try to workÅ\from the perspective of the whole, as well. I have very little question about Mr. Lanning's policies, but I question very much his ability to implement them.Åh

ÅgIndeed,Åh said Pledge, and eagerly he took out his pocket-notebook again. ÅgYou will understand if I take some notes, won't you? It is nothing important, just a private habit of mine. Obviously, I am no reporter.Åh

ÅgAs you do,Åh said the senator. ÅgI make it a habit of my own to say nothing that I would not want repeated to a third party.Åh

ÅgAll men who speak must have habits, it is only healthy,Åh said Mr. Verdot. ÅgNow Pledge here writes things down, and that's a small thing, and our young senator here watches what he says, which is a large thing, and some men who speak can only speak well if they have some drink in them, and that can be a small thing or a large thing, depending on how much drink they've had. But so long as it is necessary, why begrudge it of them?Åh

ÅgIndeed,Åh said Pledge, smiling, Ågthough I should hardly call this little practice of mine necessary.Åh

ÅgOf course not,Åh said the senator, also smiling. ÅgNot for what you do. But thenÅ\what do you do, Pledge?Åh

ÅgWhy, I? Isn't it obvious?Åh Pledge made a small flourish with his hand. ÅgI simply talk. I am a conversationalist.Åh

ÅgAh,Åh said the senator. ÅgSo what you find necessary, then, is the company of people.Åh

ÅgAs you say,Åh said Pledge. ÅgBut, please, continue with your explanation.Åh

ÅgOf course. Give me a moment to think.Åh The senator took his moment, and then continued: ÅgMr. Lanning has, in the past months, fallen greatly out of favor with the general populace. His actions, more often, are blocked; his vote is seen as a mark of corruption; and his sympathies are, well, lambasted.Åh The senator took a sip of his drink. ÅgI say that strongly, of course, but it is true. I assume you keep up with local politics, Pledge?Åh

ÅgOf course.Åh

ÅgThen you should know what I mean. Ultimately, although Mr. Lanning had still a reasonable chance of winning the electionÅ\had I not ran against himÅ\the chance of him having the same positive effect, politically, that he had in the past, was virtually nonexistent. By holding the policies that he did, he would literally do work against them.Åh The senator took another sip. ÅgNot that I am blaming him, obviously. It's not his own fault. But as his policies are my policies, and I am obliged to protect them, I felt obliged, also, to run against him. You see?Åh

ÅgAh, yes, yes, of course. The very community that put him in a position to do good, in the first place, now works to prevent it, even if it does not realize it.Åh

ÅgDepressing as that may be,Åh remarked the senator.

ÅgPerhaps. But this is a thing I can believe, if no other.Åh

Mr. Verdot said, ÅgNow, you are still receiving some counsel from the old senator, yes? I managed to get a few minutes with him just a few weeks ago, and he said that you had been most receptive.Åh

ÅgOf course!Åh said Senator Murdoch. ÅgAs I say, I still trust his judgment, even if many people do not. And after all, if one is speaking relatively, then, if the information is good, what does it matter if it is separated from its source?Åh

ÅgYes,Åh said Pledge. ÅgYes, exactly.Åh

While they stood talking, the din of the party lessened somewhat. The animated voices of gaiety had declined as several of the guests were obliged to leave, and the voices and conversations that pervaded now were quieter and more relaxed than before. When Mr. Bates left, Mr. Verdot excused himself to give a parting word to the same, and left Pledge and Senator Murdoch alone in the corner of the room, the latter holding his drink, the former holding his notebook.

ÅgI wonder,Åh said the young senator, ÅgI have heard that you are an expert in all topics of conversation. . .Åh

ÅgOh, hardly an expert,Åh said Pledge. ÅgBut I am willing to share any conversation that is offered to me.Åh

ÅgHow is your knowledge of mythology?Åh

ÅgGreek or Roman?Åh

ÅgOh, either.Åh

ÅgIt is sufficient, I imagine. Is it an interest of yours?Åh

ÅgSome aspects, some aspects. I am particularly concerned with a certain subject, something which has come up in a number of conversations with a friend of mine: the concept of an ancient automaton. A being made in the likeness of man, but not a man.Åh

ÅgA homunculus, you mean?Åh

ÅgNo, something simpler. Something not made of living tissue, but of an inanimate substance.Åh

ÅgAh, you mean the golem. But, 'mythology' is not quite the word to useÅ\what you are talking about is folklore, Jewish folklore.Åh

ÅgAs you say,Åh said the senator. He had finished his drink but was still holding the glass upright, and his eyes did not leave Pledge. ÅgWhat do you know about them?Åh

ÅgOh, not a great deal,Åh said Pledge, his eyes also fixed, but in an indeterminate direction. ÅgI had an old Jewish friend who told me about them, once, and I remember what he said. A golem was a simple creature, made of clay or mud, and activated by an inscription on the forehead, or a slip of paper in the mouth. A slip of paper was also placed in the mouth to command the golem. They were owned by rabbis, a mark of status. Or, so say the stories. Some say that Adam was a golem.Åh

ÅgAh, then you must forgive me. Golem is not what I meant; of course, now I remember. Not mythology, not folklore, but alchemy. That is what I discussed with my friend. Yes, alchemy, and the alchemist Paracelsus, who first described elementals.Åh

ÅgElementals,Åh said Pledge, Ågare rather different things altogether.Åh

ÅgYes, yes. Still robots, strictly speaking, but creatures who were created from just one type of material, just one element. Not only created from it, but drawing sustenance from it, as well, not so much a living being as a force, like an intelligent storm. The golems were powered by their inscriptionsÅ\ultimately, by God directly. But the elementals were only powered by what they were; their every action a simple expression of their quintessential nature.Åh

ÅgIndeed,Åh said Pledge. He looked around the room, eying other conversations, other people. ÅgWellÅ\ you seem to know enough about the subject. What did you want to ask me?Åg

ÅgThe question I wanted to ask you,Åh said the senator, his eyes not moving from the still form of Pledge, Ågis the same question I asked my friend. He told me he did not know the answer, not definitely; I wonder if you do? The question is this: elementals were createdÅ\that is, of course, they were said to be createdÅ\out of a single substance, a single normally lifeless substance, which is molded into the shape of a human. Traditionally they were made of earth, iron, copper, or mud. In the more eccentric tales, they're made of fire or water or even air. Or rather, the more mythical tales, when those were the four popular elements, and when men of learning spoke primarily of things that they had not actually seen.Åh

ÅgSome would say that is an ailment still with us.Åh

ÅgWould you?Åh

Pledge had to search for a second before he found his smile again. When he did, you would not know that it had ever been absent.

ÅgIf I am an expert in anything, it is something that needs only to be heard. Speaking of which, it appears that our host has been left alone, a thing quite intolerable. You will excuse me for a moment?Åh

ÅgOf course.Åh

Thus disengaged from the young senator and the young senator's alcohol-stung mouth, Pledge made his way towards the middle of the room, where Mr. Alfred, having just said goodbye to some guest or another, was indeed standing alone. As he walked, he caught Mrs. Wichter's eye, and she gave him another of her ostentatious smiles, which he returned. He turned his eyes then to his pocket-notebook, whose pages he turned back and forth absently. He closed it, wiped sweat from its smooth leather cover, and replaced it in his breast pocket.

ÅgIf you smile as much around the house as you do around fellow guests, I should think it would be a horror to live with you.Åh

ÅgThen we should consider it fortunate that I live alone.Åh The comment had come from behind, and Pledge has responded before turning. This completed, he found himself in the company of a harsh, silver-haired gentleman with whom he had not previously been acquainted.

[missing]

...all these things lack something; do you know what it is? It's complexity. Mud or metal you might shape into something like a man, but then at best you would have a mindless brute, able to follow simple orders, if anything. There is also the assumption, implicit in the process, that the substance has to be physical. Don't you see? You think, you make the being out of dirt, and the mind will follow. But what if it were the exact opposite? What if the body proceeded from the mind?Åh

He paused for a moment, but Pledge said not a word. The raconteur was sitting quite still.

ÅgNow, to build an elemental, an intelligent one, the key is complexity. Since an elemental's nature derives from its substance, a complex mind would require a complex substance. A substance, an element, that could express both emotion and desire, real objects and abstraction. A substance, also, which could be easily replenished.

ÅgHave you ever read a dictionary, Pledge?Åh

Pledge jerked slightly at the question. ÅgI doubt there is a man who hasn't.Åh

ÅgI don't mean used a dictionary, I mean read one. I mean start at the beginning, andÅ\Åg

ÅgI don't understand this,Åh said Pledge, laughing very weakly. ÅgAre you trying to accuse me of something? Of what?Åh

ÅgNothing,Åh said Senator Murdoch, Ågnothing but being a conversationalist. You said so yourself, didn't you? But no, you disagreed with me; you said the company of peopleÅ\Åg

Pledge stepped backwards abruptly, as though stepping back from a fire.

ÅgÅ\wasn't necessary,Åh finished the senator.

ÅgIf you'll excuse me,Åh said Pledge, stepping further backwards, ÅgI have toÅ\ go to the restroom. Excuse me.Åh

ÅgOf course,Åh said the senator, and he stood, watching Pledge go.

The door of the bathroom slammed behind Pledge. He stood with his hands on the sink, staring into the mirror, at his own reddening face. He was breathing and sweating as though he had been running for his life. He tried to pull his hands from the sink, but they only tightened and gripped around its edge. After some time, there was a knocking at the door.

ÅgPledge?Åh said Mr. Verdot, from outside. ÅgPledge, are you in there?Åh

Pledge's mouth formed the word. ÅgPledge,Åh he said, very quietly.

ÅgPledge?Åh eventually the voice went away.

ÅgPledge,Åh said Pledge. ÅgPledge. Pledge.Åh The word was not his own.

Pledge coughed several times, and spat into the sink. The spot of spittle was thick and pasty. Shaking somewhat, he put his hand into his breast pocket and took out the pocket-notebook. He flipped through the pages, stopping halfway through, at his last entry, written just in the past hour. He flipped back a bit, then forward again. He tore out a page.

ÅgPledge.Åh It wasn't clear who said it. It wasn't clear who said anything.

Pledge folded the page into fourths, then into eights. He opened his mouth and placed the small square of paper on the back of his tongue. He stared into the eyes of his reflection as the muscles of his throat worked, and slowly he mouthed every word as he felt it.
