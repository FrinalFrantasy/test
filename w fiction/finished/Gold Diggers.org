SCENE
(Two men, RICHARD and BENJAMIN, are on a beach, searching for things with metal detectors. They are wearing puffy jackets and gloves.
After searching for some time, RICHARD stops, seeing something on the ground. He stoops to pick it up, then holds it in the light dramatically.)

RICHARD
I have found―

BENJAMIN
You haven't found anything.

RICHARD (louder)
I have found a priceless treasure. I have found the remains of an artifact of incalculable worth.

(Benjamin looks at the thing RICHARD is holding.)

BENJAMIN
You've found a desiccated pretzel.

RICHARD
I have also found that that an attitude of hope and optimism leads to a healthy and long life, while one of cynicism leads to short life filled with despair.

BENJAMIN
How can you know that optimism results in long life?

RICHARD
I've lived this long, haven't I?

BENJAMIN
You're twenty-seven. It's not exactly a rare accomplishment.

RICHARD
Yes, but I feel wonderful! As well I should; I've got the world in front of me. I've got good friends, good weather, and the leisure time to enjoy them.

BENJAMIN
I wouldn't exactly call this “good weather”.

RICHARD
It's a beach. It's beach weather.

BENJAMIN
It's a beach in October. It's October weather. Which is to say it's forty degrees.

RICHARD
It's always beach weather at the beach.

BENJAMIN
Furthermore, the reason you have all this leisure time is you don't have a job.

RICHARD
I don't need a job! I don't want a job and I don't have a job.

BENJAMIN
You do appreciate eating, though.

RICHARD (happily)
I have you!

BENJAMIN
I don't have a job.

RICHARD
You did.

BENJAMIN
Yes. And now I have a metal detector.

RICHARD
Two metal detectors.

BENJAMIN
Yours is borrowed. Richard, what are we doing out here?

RICHARD
We're treasure hunting―

BENJAMIN
No no no we're not treasure hunting. We're wasting time on a stupid search for a stupid treasure just because some patch-eyed stump-legged crusty old sea captain with nine fingers got drunk and told us there was gold buried here.

RICHARD
That's not treasure hunting?

BENJAMIN
It's snipe-hunting.

RICHARD
Benjamin, Benjamin listen. I want to tell you something. Call it a story. This is a story about a man who worked for eleven months at a hardware store, but got sick of it after two months. He got sick of it and then for the next five months he lapsed into depression, which left five months―

BENJAMIN
Four months

RICHARD
―Four months to get himself together, realize it wasn't what he wanted to do with his life, and get out of it with what savings he could, and also a few stolen hardware supplies and a metal detector.

BENJAMIN
You said you borrowed the metal detector.

RICHARD
I tell you lots of things. But this is what's important: our dreams. That's something no one can take from us. What are you dreams, Benjamin?

BENJAMIN
Well, last night I dreamed that I was pursued by enormous pigeons that made sounds like freight trains.

RICHARD
Did you get away?

BENJAMIN
No, but I took a few of them out with bricks.

RICHARD
And that's what you've got to hold on to. That's what you've got to remember. Now, do you feel better? Are you ready to find that buried gold?

BENJAMIN
I don't think I'm ready.

RICHARD
Do you want a pretzel?

BENJAMIN
I suppose.

(RICHARD gives him the pretzel.)

BENJAMIN
How long are we going to search, anyway?

RICHARD
As long as it takes.

BENJAMIN
That sounds like a long time.

RICHARD
Yeah, it probably is. Don't you have a job?

BENJAMIN
I told you, they fired me.

RICHARD
Why'd they do that? You were their star employee!

BENJAMIN
Well, I did drink on the job a bit.

RICHARD
Not much, though. Did they really fire you over that?

BENJAMIN
(Nods.)

RICHARD
Man. You'd think being a doctor would be stressful enough.

BENJAMIN
Yeah. . . Are we going to just stand here and talk?

RICHARD
No! We're going to find treasure. Gold. We are going to find gold a-plenty, enough so that we don't have to work any more. So much gold that we can each have a mansion built for us, mansions with big-screen TVs built right into the walls, and real high-quality pool tables. And attached to each mansion, we'll have huge garages―why, you'll have a garage as big as a normal house, and inside that garage, you'll have a genuine Lamborghini.

BENJAMIN
What'll you have in your garage?

RICHARD
A unicorn.

BENJAMIN
Alright. I'll drink to that.

(BENJAMIN produces a flask from an inside coat pocket and takes a long swig.)
