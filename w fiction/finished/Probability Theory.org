Probability Theory

I was going to jump. Do you understand me? I was going to jump. . .

I headed to the roof of the hotel I was staying at, the Green Manhattan. I pushed aside the bellhop, went straight to the elevator and jabbed the button for the top floor. I fumed all the way up. Some people can get sore at a person, but by golly, I make an art of it. I thought that when Bill put me down like that, when he ruined my reputation and tossed away our friendship in a single gesture, I knew that that was simply the last straw. The world had given me a girl and then taken her back, and then it had taken my house and now it had taken my job, but by God, I wouldn't let it take my life- I would shove my life down its throat. In the back of my mind I knew that I was a wealthy man and I could make things right, and farther back than that I knew that if I were to calm down and breathe a little I would get over it, but at that moment I was determined to prove that I was serious. Oh, I had threatened to kill myself before, but those times were nothing compared to this. I was serious about it this time.

The elevator beeped at the twentieth floor and I walked out onto the roof. There were people everywhere. Excellent! I could make a decent show of it, and I certainly wouldn't lose my nerve. Perhaps I'd make the evening news. Talk about going out with a bang!

It really was a beautiful building. Modern silver and soft gray, half overlooking the city and half overlooking the water. The roof was a cross between an observation deck and a lobby. There were stone benches and chairs and tables, and the whole place sat against the open sky, so that you felt at once very large against the streets below you, and very small against the office buildings around you. You could put a quarter in a pair of metal binoculars and you'd get half a minute to stare at the sailboats off in the distance. There were people talking, taking pictures, sipping drinks, even playing cards. There was almost no breeze, even this high up, and it was nice and warm. It was a beautiful day. It was a beautiful day on a beautiful building and I loved it and I hated that I loved it. I strode calmly towards the edge; there was no rush. No reason to look panicked. I wasn't panicked, because I knew exactly what I was going to do. Then I remembered the two times I had thought the same thought just before chickening out, and I sped up a little.

I reached the edge and looked down. Cars crawled around on pencil-width gray roads far, far beneath me. I drew in my breath automatically, then gulped and forced myself to put my hands on the railing. I was about to climb over when I hesitated, realizing that if I fell from here I could easily land in the middle of the street, or even right on top of one of those cars. I might cause an accident. Now, I'll admit that kindness and generosity towards my fellow man are not qualities with which I am well-acquainted; but I believe in karma, and the idea that I might drag along half a dozen perfectly content souls in a journey across the river Styx just doesn't sit with me. So I went to another edge. Another street. I was walking towards the third edge, and beginning to wonder if I really wanted to kill myself, when a man brushed past me so fast he nearly knocked me over. I stumbled, swore, looked around, saw him halfway across the roof. Didn't even notice me. If there was any proof that this was not a world fit to live in, well, that was it.

I got the edge I was looking for, one that faced the water. Nothing below me but trees and sidewalk. Perfect. As long as I could hit the sidewalk. I didn't want get torn up on the way down. No, one single splat, that was the way. No pain. I am not a masochist. I'll kill myself, certainly, but something that hurts? Count me out.

I stepped up the small step that was against the railing. OK. This is it, I knew or thought. Here I go. It occurred to me I ought to make an announcement, something humorous or philosophical. Going out with class, that seemed the thing to do. I had cleared my throat and gotten as far as saying ¡§I-¡¨ when someone screamed.

It was a woman, and it wasn't a bad scream. It was one of those ridiculous moments where a ridiculous sex decides to take an action used to show horror and pain and use it for joy instead. She screamed and everybody turned ¡V away from me. I was furious. Couldn't anyone pay attention to me, even now? I stormed over to the other side of the roof again to see what all the fuss was about. I saw the woman, standing at the corner of the roof, and she was embracing a man ¡V the man who had ran past me and nearly knocked me over. She was laughing and crying or possibly something in between, and he had picked her up and was spinning around, her bright blue dress fluttering about her like so much woven light, and then he put her down and kissed her. The crowd was silent now, watching the strange event take place. Finally the couple parted ¡V by a few inches, no farther than their arms could reach ¡V and she was saying,

¡§Sam, oh Sam! Oh, I waited for you, I waited at the house and when you didn't come I went to the office and then I didn't know where to go so I came here, because I remembered that you said that the view was the best in the city, that you could see the water and boats and oh, Sam- I'm sorry! I'm so sorry. . .¡¨

He was talking now:

¡§Becky, Becky I'm sorry, I was mad and I was foolish and I was wrong, and I tried to stay away from you but I thought about your eyes and your hair and your smile and I knew I couldn't, I knew I had to find you again and I- I went back to the house, I must have just missed you, I went back to the house and you weren't there, and I thought- I was so afraid, I thought you had left-¡¨

Her again:

¡§Oh Sam, I couldn't- I could never leave you. I tried and I couldn't, I couldn't because I tried to talk and you weren't there to talk to and- and when you're not there I can't even think because I need you to hold me. . .¡¨

They kissed again, and though it lasted ages no one spoke because no one had anything to say, and then they broke again and he was breathless as he said:

¡§Becky, Becky I can't lose you again. I lost you today and it was awful. I thought I'd died. When I came through the elevator and saw you and you hadn't left, I- I could breathe again. I can't lose you again. Becky- will you marry me?¡¨

She was crying again ¡V or still crying ¡V and she was holding on to him as if he were the only person in the world. When she tried to talk she couldn't, so she just nodded, and they kissed again, and this time it lasted a while. The crowd, at first taken aback, now cheered enthusiastically at this couple who had so suddenly impressed themselves onto everyone's emotions.

It was a beautiful thing on a beautiful building on a beautiful day, and I was dumbstruck. It was absurd. It was theatrical. It was improbable. I tried in vain to explain my thoughts to the people standing around me, because I knew that they were important thoughts, but when I opened my mouth my mind failed me. Where previously I had contained a grim resolve, a stubborn opinion of the world, there was now was a swirling chaos of emotions, incredulity and surprise and confusion, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out which one I was feeling. I tried to work it out as I went back down the elevator and through the lobby and over to a small restaurant, and by the time I knew where I was Bill was there too, and he was apologizing, or something ¡V I was still in too much of a daze to know for sure. When I finally came to myself, I looked him straight in the eye and told him that I was a childish, unreasonable and petty person, and refused to let him leave until he agreed with me.

Things have worked out for me pretty well since then. I didn't lose my job, after all, and Bill and I became the friends we had always pretended we were. I never thought about jumping again, and for what it's worth, I don't think I would've jumped that day on the hotel, either. But, damn. . . of all the things you could see on top of a hotel, how unlikely is that?
