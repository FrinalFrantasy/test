And shall one of the stories indeed by of the fluid group of friends?

At least three totally separate groups of friends.

Verbal battle of sorts, modelled playfully off of kung-fu scenes. Leader of good guys & eventual champion is the quiet, wise type, dispensing wisdom.

One couple finds love through goofy, shared phonecalls & hearsay & group activities. Their final scene is their first time together alone. Later is their (presumed) offspring.

By lifetime? That will make things more difficult, and might damage metaphorical/metaphysical nature of narrative...

Average age can't be too low. Say, 15-20, as a rule?

Can't be a super regular place, has to have a bit of separation in time... maybe not even the same place? Of course! Theseus' Friends! Move around and change so much, difficult to ever say whether it's the same group.

Constants or throwbacks: nothing terribly obvios, like the first character returning at the end (though something like this can be IMPLIED).

Flow of story can mimic human life, for instance lingering late at the first location, losing many friends and comforts with the first transition.

Leave little untouched. The story is not about tearful reunion, but it can contain an instance of tearful reunion.

Does it begin with the beginning, end with the end? Doing so allows for symmetry, for slightl more meaning. Not doing so allows for legend and a certain quality of timelessness.

James, a young artist? Ray, or a pseudonym of? Le Guin, Loomis, Sturgeon... James, Ray, Ursula, Theodore, Isaac, Oliver, Joanna...

The story is just barely about race. The class distinctions more prevalent are, say, athlete vs. tradesman vs. artist, gentleman vs. worldly guys, even old fashioned vs. new fashioned.

Keep age under 21, at least for the most part. (probably under 18)

Symbolism will ultimately be on a back burner; this is a story about people.
