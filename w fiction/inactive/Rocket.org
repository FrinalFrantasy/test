There had been lampyrids last time, hovering just over the surface of the water. _He_ remembered. Before that he remembered the way the very small waves on the surface of a river broke the light apart into tiny things that fluttered, clearly fireflies. Before that they had been lightning bugsÅ\and at another time, fire beetles. After they were fireflies they were lampyrids. Family Lampyridae, order Coleoptera. Well, sitting now beside the river was a being of an order much more interesting than Coleoptera. But why shouldn't there still be fireflies? So: he looked down at the river and almost, almost touching the top, there were fireflies.

And his reverie was almost broken by Jones behind him saying, ÅgCarl? Hey, Carl. You gonna go down there?Åh

Perhaps he would. Perhaps he would.

ÅgCarl?Åh

ÅgYeah. You think I should?Åh

ÅgI think you should do something.Åh

"I'm thinking."

"That's great, you're thinking. That's great. I'm thinking, too. I'll bet Nordif is thinking." Jones turned his head to shout over his shoulder, "Nordif! Are you thinking?"

Nordif, standing with a few other men, hesitated for a moment, then said, "Yes, sir!"

"So we're all thinking," Jones said to Carl. "The issue I am having right now is timing, Jones. I have put this off for... that is to say, I was hoping that this situation was bringing itself to a conclusion. I thought that the chances of me having to actually come hereÅ\today, no less..."

"Hey, Carl. What are you talking about?"

Carl sighed. "I don't - I don't know." ÅgYou on my back about the schedule, too?Åh

ÅgI'd rather be on your back about her, but I'd hope you know the score. God knows, one of these girls is enough for a man's nerves, without that you had to get tied up with both.Åh

ÅgDo you have to compare them like that?Åh

ÅgI'm just saying, whatever you're gonna do, you don't got much time to do it in.Åh

Carl sighed and folded his arms and unfolded them again and adjusted his belt and turned to look at the Lieutenant.

ÅgWhat do I say?Åh

The Lieutenant raised his eyebrows. ÅgIf I knew that...Åh

She was waiting, though. All this time he was still up here, she was waiting, so he rubbed all his fingers together and started down the overgrown stairs, reflecting that he wasn't worried that she was waiting, but rather that she wasn't waiting for him.

.

He tried not to get dirt on his uniform ... looking donwn threw him into other memories...

.

Yeah, she's a good ship, sheÅ\

hm.

I'm sorry. It's normal to call the ships she. It's just how it is.

I never was bothered by that. I never once said I was bothered by that. (I just wish you wouldn't treat her like she's really her)

.

ÅgI'm just saying, whatever you're gonna do, you don't got much time to do it.Åh

.

ÅgIt wasn't such and such. Such and such just gave me time to think.Åh

It's just a space station. They even got the gravity worked out and everything.

.

You like it up here?

He smiled. ÅgEveryone looks like bugs.Åh

.

I don't like throwing up.

It won't do that.

It always makes me sick.

You make yourselfÅ\ they've got it fixed.

.

It's hard to be awkward with someone you love that much, but you can manage it if you miss a kiss like that.

This time (present) he didn't try to make the kiss.

.

Didn't you use up fuel landing here? How much did that cost?

He scratched his head sheepishly. ÅgAbout half a million dollars.Åh

He went back to the rocket, not far away. The old rockets put fire everywhere; you had to be half a mile away to be safe. But these new ones were very clean, and you only had to be about three hundred feet away. Well, she was about three hundred and fifty, and so all she got was a real warm breeze that came around her ankles and stomach and curled her hair a bit, but that was about it, and the whole time the rocket went up in fire glory she never turned around and looked at it, but kept her eyes right on that slow river.
