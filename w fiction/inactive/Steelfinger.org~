The Redemption of Steelfinger

The journal of Richter Corde, infantryman of the Slatid Army

* June 30th, the Seventh Year of the War; the Lifts

Seventeen days out of Tongues, counting my steps and watching the mountains draw nearer, and the Captain has given me a new journal! I am astounded at the man. Early this morning he tossed the heavy leather-bound book at my feet while I breakfasted, and said something about having found it in the city. Then he went back to his tent before I could think of anything to say. I tried to ask him about it when next I saw him, but he would not acknowledge that he had given me anything. If it did come from Tongues, I wonder that he waited two weeks to give it to me, unless he just bargained for it with one of the soldiers. This late in the play, the Captain still surprises me. I had thought he had given up charitability years ago, along with the rest of his good spirits.

I am grateful for the new book. My old journal, my only escape from boredom, has seen too many days and too many words. I am afraid now that it may not even survive long enough for me to deliver it to a place of safe-keeping, though if it does not, I suppose it will not be too great a loss to the world. A soldier's life is a dull life when it is recounted honestly, as I have tried to do.

I am glad to be out of Tongues. I was glad to be in it, as well. Everything about that place is contradictory. I had heard tell of cities this near the heart of the Commonwealth, where one could find brothels and sanctuaries on the same street, sometimes across from one another, but Tongues was the first time I had ever actually seen it. Its name fits, as well, for there are nearly as many languages used there as there are people to use them. Bridgemont, who grew up there, told me that in earlier times the Mayors had tried to force a single language on their citizens, if only as a primary one, but they would not have it. Tongues is too old, and there are families there who trace their ancestry back to its beginnings. The rich and noble do not deign to learn the languages of their rivals, though the average vagabond knows at least three. Most any other city would long have been crippled by such conditions, but Tongues is too active and too alive. It resembles any other large city, except that there is a thick layer of commerce based entirely on the interpretation and translation of one language into another. I could not determine the exact web of influences that might in one street herald a given language, and in the next stigmatize it, suffice to say that exchange in business is invariably done with the use of interpreters, often whoever happens to be available. At one point, I found myself in a bakery, where I was quickly drafted into being one part of a three-link dealing between the head Baker and our Lieutenant: the Lieutenant speaking to me, I translating from our speech to Coorish, and one of the shop-boys translating from Coorish to the head Baker's own language, which I could not recognize by sound; and the Baker's words coming back the opposite way. It was a headache for all of us by the time we finally worked out a deal.

Because of its languages, Tongues has proven largely invulnerable to political upheaval. You might sweep the city away by force, if you had the means, but to lead a revolt or coup would be ridiculous. Sooner would you convince one group of cats to unite against another.

Today was our last day, or nearly so, upon what the maps all call the Far Hills, but which men call the Lifts. Murrough just calls them hell, and I am inclined to agree with him. It is one thing to see the hills in the distance, covered in grass and sporting hardly more than a rodent-hole here and there, but try marching on and over and through them for two weeks and you'll wish the whole damn crop be leveled. Even the horses seem annoyed with the things. Everyone has been wondering why we don't simply take the road north, but the Captain will not tell us, though he is adamant there is a good reason. Politics, surely. We were welcome enough in Tongues, where men of any allegiance can find hospitality, provided they look carefully enough, but I am not fooling myself; the [] is not popular in this part of the world. I think the Captain is hurrying to get us back to the northern front, where we can face the enemy, who merely kill us, and not our own citizens, who distrust us. We will settle our differences with the people after we have won the war, and are heroes.

If I have to wait until then before I can take more than two nights' sleep in a bed that doesn't fit on my back, I think I will go mad. I would have liked to have looked around Tongues, odd place that it is; to have seen their library, at least. I had even planned on buying a new journal, myself, and was disappointed when we left before I had found a place that sold them.

* July 2nd; the plains between the Lifts and Loiter

Early today Gaunt, my Sergeant, led me away from the camp and showed me a large stone, fifteen feet tall, half-buried at the bottom of a large dirt basin. It's face was covered in inscriptions, and small diagrams arranged on the edges of concentric circles. Gaunt told me it was an old Warding Stone, created to protect the city from its enemies. The Stone was inscribed with the names of the enemies—not their true names, but something close—so that just to be near it made them more vulnerable. This one was clearly very old, and the inscriptions would have been difficult to read even if I knew the language. Besides, I did not think Tongues had been assaulted by any great singular evil in the past century; so the stone must be older than that. I told Gaunt this much, and he agreed. He also told me how it came to be so far from the city: apparently, many years after the stone had been erected, the city was attacked by marauders. They looted the place, taking the stone with them, somehow moving or rolling it the many miles past the hills to the spot where we stood, before they suffered an attack by the Imperial Army and were destroyed. Afterwards the goods were returned to the city, but the stone, whose purpose had long ago been annulled, was judged not worth the effort of moving back. So it sat here, in a shallow depression of dirt amongst the wild fields north of Tongues, and slowly eroded away. I asked Gaunt how he knew this, and he told me he had spent some time in the city in the company of an old man, who told him about the stone and where to find it, should he care to. He had told me because he knew of my interest in such things.

Gaunt is a good man. He was drafted into the force a long time ago, when the Commonwealth was desperate for soldiers, and took the name Gaunt after refusing to give his real name. He is tall and thin, and it fits well. All these years later, it is the only name any of us know him by, and he is as devoted to our cause as any of us. He admits freely that he would have little use for life outside of the force.

While we were looking at the Warding Stone, examining it from different sides, he noted casually that the thing had almost certainly been originally erected by members of the Amaranthine Order, led by Tongues' own Holder of the Peace. I suppose this should not have surprised me, but I am a bit slow in the mornings. The Holders of the Peace are a modern establishment—or at least, that's how I think of them. Obviously they have existed for some time, but for there to be evident such a tangible link between the present and this old stone, well, it made me shiver. This stone is the sort of thing that was made during the old times, when battles were decided by magic, and a skilled or corrupted practitioner might destroy entire regiments of the enemy by will alone. The old times, too, are when the [] lived, and the dragons, and the immortals—although I suppose the immortals' name must be inaccurate if they lived then and are dead now. I don't know. I have seen thaumaturgy of various types practiced by virtuosos of their fields, but it is hard for me to imagine how such a small thing might be leveled against a man, to destroy him the same way a sword or pike might. But there are stories.

Of course, what makes the old stories odd is their speaking of thaumaturgy as a separate and distinct Art, not merely a transition or augmentation on an existing discipline. To speak of modern magic—well, there is no modern magic that is not part of an existing discipline, and people who reputed to use magic exclusively are as unlikely as people who claim to use none at all. It is a part of all of our lives, in this modern age. In practice it's difficult to separate it from skill.

I am as meager a practitioner as there is, but still I have a little knowledge in the field that interests me. I am a writer, as evidenced by this journal, so I know a few shortcuts valuable to anyone who does not wish to go into poverty pursuing the same: I can copy words onto four or five pages at once, to save time; I can restore the color to a faded manuscript; and I can create for myself the small containers of ink which fit into the modern capsule pen (though to my chagrin, I have never been able to get ink which is precisely black in color, and must settle with this shade of very dark red which is all too common amongst novice writers). Anyone who calls himself a writer ought to be able to do these things, if only for practical reasons. Without such conveniences, it's likely that book-writing and especially book-reading would become prohibitively expensive ventures for any but the wealthy, or those content to read perhaps two or three books in a year.

That is roughly all of the magic I know. Aside from boiling a pot of water, or moving a small object; minor things of which any person of rudimentary education should be capable, though the amount of energy required to perform them makes them rarely worth the effort.

That's enough for tonight. If I am not careful, I will soon have a book full of babble.

* July 5th; Loiter

Finally, the Captain allowed us to overtake the road the rest of the way to Loiter, giving our feet something solid to step on for a change. Loiter sits near one of the larger sections of marshlands on this part of the land, and though we've been able to avoid the swamps, we've spent most of the days out of the Lifts walking on dirt that felt as though it had just been plowed. It's hard to imagine how tiresome walking on soft ground can be until you have to do it for hours on end. This close to the city, however, the land on either side of the road has become almost impassible, so the road acts as a bridge of solid ground.

Loiter is a walled city, with only two gates large enough to admit an army. Our road approached from the south, and the gates were on the east and west walls. So it was that our regiment was coming around the side of the city, just a few hundred yards from the wall, when one of the small side-gates opened up, and there came out of the place three men, running for all they were worth. A moment or so later, a group of armed men who appeared to be militia came hurtling out after them, and along with these, a fat man dressed in a gown of dark red, who did not run but barked orders at the militiamen. While we watched, one of the fleeing men stumbled and fell, and in an instant the armed men were on him, beating him and holding him to the ground. The Captain called a halt and started forward to meet the red man, whom I assumed was a city official, while the other two of the three passed the Captain and his guard by no more than twenty feet, and gave him, their fallen comrade and us not a passing look. Our men, knowing nothing of the situation, neither moved nor gave chase, and the three men made their way through our ranks as best they could.

I was near the front, and I heard the official shouting as he and the Captain drew near.

"Stop them! Stop those men!"

The Captain, who made no pretense of hurry, waited until he was close enough to speak to the man without shouting. Our regiment had become spread out after coming over the road; the two men still had a way to run before they would be free of our ranks.

The Captain said something to the official, who said back, "I am Oliver Calcaddun, Magistrate of Loiter. Stop those men! You are [], stop those men! They are bound by law!"

The Captain turned around and shouted to those soldiers who were close enough to hear an order to stop the fleeing men. The order was relayed down our lines, faster than men can run, and the fleeing men were stopped before they had a chance to finally extricate themselves from us. In a minute they were brought forward, each held with their arms behind their backs by [] soldiers, each kicking and fighting and swearing at anyone they saw. The soldiers threw them on the ground between the Captain and Magistrate Calcaddun, where they immediately tried to run, and were thrown back down again. After a few tries they gave up, and sat huddled in the spot between the two men, alternatively muttering, cursing, and apparently seeking forgiveness from the Magistrate. I saw the man who had tripped before, held by two militiamen, not struggling, not doing anything but looking at the ground.

"Magistrate Calcaddun," said the Captain, in what I recognized as his diplomatic voice, "is your militia so poor that you are forced to run down common criminals personally? Or is this a graver matter?"

"This is nothing of your concern. I thank you for your assistance. Now the law will complete its purpose." He jerked his head to one of his militiamen, who strode forward to the captured men, drawing a heavy executioner's sword with a squared end. "I apologize that your first taste of Loiter is to see such men as these, Captain Hearn, but I assure you you will find few so low remaining in the city. Yes, I know who you are. Unlike the other Magistrates I do not ignore - "

"Are you going to kill these men, Magistrate?"

The fat man scowled at being interrupted. "No, my man Jack is going to." He indicated the militiaman with the sword.

"They have had their trial?"

"There is no need for a trial. They have committed offenses which precludes that necessity."

"Yes? What have they done?"

Magistrate Calcaddun fixed the Captain with as even a look as I have ever seen. "They have offended me," he said.

The Captain simply raised his eyebrows. However, as two of the militiamen forced one of the offenders onto the ground, and the one called Jack was just raising his sword, the Captain held up a hand and said, "Stop!" and Jack hesitated.

"This is none of your concern, Captain," said the Magistrate, his face turning slightly red.

"It is absolutely my concern if I find that in the absence of a [] presence you have been abusing your command, Magistrate."

“I would not expect a simple military Captain to understand the complexities of city governance.”

“Nor should you expect him to accept said complexities on faith.”

The Magistrate suddenly smiled and spread his hands in a gesture that was sickly sweet.

"What do you want from me?" he drawled. "I will not harm you or impede you. I will open the city's doors to you. Why would I otherwise? I remain—" and here he bowed— "His Lordship's humble servant. Merely, allow me to conduct my affairs as befits my office. I will have my men show you into the city." He started to motion to two others of the militia.

"Magistrate," said the Captain tiredly, "I am not trying to pursue a personal vendetta against you. I, too, am His Lordship's humble servant, and as a Captain of the [], I would be neglecting the affairs of my own office if I did not ask you to show me what crimes these men have committed, or what judge has sentenced them to death."

The Magistrate considered the Captain while he let his smile slack. For some moments he appeared to be thinking; and he licked his lips.

"You would be content with a trial?"

"Of course."

"Jack!" The man hurried forward. "Do you have any paper? Go get some. And a candle. Yes." Jack took off running towards the city, leaving the large sword lying on the ground. The two captured men were still on their knees, and they looked up at the Captain like one might look at one's long-lost father. The man being held by two militiamen did not move, but he let his gaze wander darkly from the Captain to the Magistrate to the sword.

"Where is your Holder?" said the Captain in a slightly different voice. "It would do well of him to be a party to this."

"He is indisposed," said the Magistrate.

I shifted. Indisposed? What did that mean? I found that my mind was wondering if the Magistrate had had him killed. This man, this fat bureaucrat, kill a Holder of the Peace? No, that was ridiculous. The Holders are nearly invulnerable, in their way. But surely there was more wrong here than an overextension of power.

After a minute, Jack returned, holding a roll of parchment and a red candle. When he arrived, the Magistrate, who had not taken his eyes off of the Captain the whole time, took the candle. He snapped his fingers to light it, and handed it to another militiaman, then took a pen from an inside pocket of his dark red jerkin and gave it to Jack.

"Take this down," he told Jack.

He then recited from memory the document required for a trial and execution. At the part that called for witnesses he spoke to two of his militiamen, who both agreed that the men were guilty. At the part that called for the accused to defend themselves, the captured men all began to talk at once, but the Magistrate spoke over them, saying that in cases of contempt the accused were not permitted to defend themselves, and in that moment he appointed someone named Whilk, the man he had given the candle, as their defender. The Magistrate waited, and Whick said nothing. One of the men on the ground started to gibber inchoately [incoherently]. At no point did the Magistrate or the Captain ever look away from one another.

"I have appointed these men in the required capacities," said the Magistrate. "As Magistrate Appointed of Loiter, I act as judge. I hereby condemn these men to be executed by beheading. Jack, put your name as the executioner."

Jack finished writing. "Wax," said the Magistrate, taking the parchment, and Whick came over with the red candle and dripped some wax onto the bottom of the document. The Magistrate pulled a necklace from beneath his shirt collar, detached a silver ring from where it hung, and pressed the top of the ring into the wax. As I am thinking about this now, I imagine he keeps the ring on a necklace because it will not fit on any of his fat fingers. He held his hand over the wax to dry it.

"Would you care to check it?" he asked the Captain.

"I don't think that'll be necessary."

The Magistrate nodded and smiled again. He handed the document to Whick, who carefully rolled it up and slid it into his pocket. Behind them, the militiamen were moving about, and Jack had retrieved his sword from the ground. One of the captured men had been dragged forward and pushed onto his knees. He was crying.

My mind was working slowly, and I did not realize what was happening until Jack had already raised the sword, and I only just managed to look away. Shouldn't I be used to this sort of thing? I am a soldier. I suppose I have not been in enough battles. I should stay so lucky.

When the second man was brought forward, I tried to watch, but he started begging for mercy, and my stomach turned. Damn.

The two militiamen holding the quiet man started to lead him forward, but he slipped out of their arms and bolted at the Captain. I don't know if he was trying to hold him hostage or beg for protection, but Bridgemont, who generally acts as the Captain's bodyguard, stepped between them and hit the man in the stomach with the pommel of his sword. He went down, but came up again almost at once with a tiny dagger he had gotten from his boot. Bridgemont went after him, along with Scheild, and one of the militiamen. He fought much longer than I expected for someone who had already been beaten twice.

The four men finally disengaged themselves, the fugitive now quite bloody and bruised (I saw later that he had lost the tip of the little finger on his right hand to his own knife when Bridgemont turned his hand), Bridgemont behind him with his arm around the man's neck. The Magistrate motioned for Bridgemont to step aside so that Jack could kill the man.

“You’ll die for this!” croaked the captured man; the first time we had heard him speak. “Calcaddun! Calcaddun, you’ll die for this! Those were my brothers! Calcaddun! You killed my family!”

The Magistrate gave the man an unimpressed look. “It is less than you tried to do to me.”

The man started cursing and shouting so that Bridgemont tightened his hold on the man's throat and made him stop.

“The wheel never stops turning[],” said the Magistrate to the man.

“Bridgemont,” said the Captain, “are you wounded?”

“Eh?” Bridgemont used his disengaged hand to feel at his forehead, where a small cut had appeared during the struggle. “It’s nothing serious, sir.”

“Magistrate,” said the Captain, turning back to our host and indicating the captured man, “this man has wounded one of my soldiers. He must be tried on this offence.”

“He is to be killed already, if you wish to abuse the body afterwards, I have no complaint.”

“No, I think the offense against His Lordship’s Army takes precedent. Don’t worry, we will not be lenient.”

The Magistrate’s face turned a darker shade of red. He thought he was supposed to be made a fool of. “I tell you, this man— “

“—Will be tried according to his crime,” said the Captain. “If he is found guilty, then we will kill him. If he is not, then we will give him to you, and you may kill him. The law must be upheld.”

The Magistrate glared at the Captain for a while. Then he said, “See that it is,” and spat on the ground.

The Captain had Bridgemont and Scheild bind the captured man and escort him for the rest of the day. After this had been done, and the bodies of the other two men removed, the Magistrate showed us into the city, friendly as you please. The Captain followed him, and the two of them spoke with each other for an hour or more as we soldiers settled in. Politics, again. 

* July 5th, night; Loiter

We have been in Loiter for most of the day now, and I am finding it a fascinating city, if gluttonous. It seems that what amounts to reasonable living here is what one would call riches in most cities, even this near the heart of the Commonwealth. What is odd is that it seems as though no one cares. I was surprised at first to see how little work these people do, considering their obvious wealth, but that’s foolish; obviously it is a population more of nobles and the already-rich than of common workers. Actually, what seems to occupy more time here than anything else is an almost universal devotion to the Arts. So far as I can tell, any person of real stature in this city is not considered complete until he takes to one of the formal Arts, be that painting, poetry, music, storytelling, or whatever else you can think of. There are carpenters and carvers and things as well, but they only produce intricate, expensive, and generally impractical things. Beautiful, though.

We had some time, after settling in, simply to wander about the city, so I stopped a citizen in the street and asked him where their library was. But, ha! I was wrong! They don’t have one library, but three. I followed his directions to the largest one, a building I had taken earlier for a courthouse or sanctuary, and, trembling slightly, I went in. I don’t know why. I only kept thinking to myself that I was in the presence of more written words, more knowledge, probably than I had ever been since my few years at Westliffe. I was not disappointed. The library contains some hundred thousands of manuscripts, scrolls, and records. They span the polished stone floor in shelves upon shelves, which reach so high that the majority can only be reached by ladder. At the first shelf I stopped at I found a book of Saltien poetry, brought or copied from the distant islands across the Thundering Sea; and one of poetry in the language of the Red Peoples, who have long departed this world; and even one that hearkens to my home of Cooron, though the book uses the name “Côron,” which is not used nowadays. 

When I had my wits about me (I was a bit like a child given a fortune), I asked a librarian, a kind man named Matthias, if they had, as I had heard, a copy of the Myriad Roses, and he showed it to me at once. I had long promised myself that I must look at this book if ever I was given the chance; if not for myself, then in respect for its great significance. The book was on a low, thick shelf which contained a great many works about, and a precious few works by, a very ancient race.
We know very little of how this world came to be, or how the first men came to walk upon it. What we do know is that before there were men as we understand them, there commanded the forces of the world a race a beings, older than can be imagined, who were the harbingers of men. They are far removed from this era, and it is likely that if their structures remain, we will never be able to recognize them as other than the natural formations of the ground—though some accounts reckon that they carved out the oceans, and erected the mountains.

We do have a little of their writings, however. So far as we can tell, they wrote only poetry and song; or else all their histories have simply been lost. Their language is a beautiful one, and terrible, for they used no letters or words, but only patterns and shapes, which may change in size and direction, and sometimes keep the same meaning, and sometimes not; and entire books (or what would amount to a book) are found carved onto single tablets of stone, with the entire work styled to describe a particular shape, or to mirror the smaller shapes within; and often, the whole of the work is composed of a single unbroken line.

The most is known about their object-poetry, which is composed all of threes and sixes and nines and twelves. The chief thing about their language, I am told, are their descriptions of objects and of individuals; each object is encased in a complex, sometimes enormous circular shape, describing it in the utmost detail, and the interactions between the objects are the lines and patterns between the circles. Their poetry, too, is about objectsBecause we know nothing of their spoken language, we cannot tell whether they used rhyme or meter. But we do know their basic object-poem, called the syxtte.

The syxtte of the ancient people, or the beetle-people (because their shape-words for “person” and “beetle” are so similar as to be indistinguishable they are often called the beetle-people), contains six objects; each object is used with four of the others in a total of four sequences, or sentences. The final poem consists of twelve sentences, each sentence referencing two objects; each object, then, is referenced four times, once each with all but one of the other objects. Thus there are three additional, unwritten connections between these ‘mirror’ or ‘opposing’ objects.

1 See the grass: green and long, it glistens in the morning sun.
2 The mother-thrush steps lightly; the dew has fallen here too.
3 She will be wary if she hears the dark snake,
4 Who ever lurks, shadow-like, between the narrow blades.
5 All through the old tree do the sunlight beams trickle,
6 And where they fall upon the grass, all is made uncertain.
7 The cunning snake may gleam the same as the dew,
8 So that the thrush is afraid to go even near the tree.
9 But the grass is growing; the tree has long stopped.
10 And when the dead thing topples, the snake will be revealed,
11 And neither bright dew nor green grass will protest
12 When the thrush, in the wisdom of the sun, flies and sings for joy.

The objects are the grass, the sun, the thrush, the dew, the snake, and the tree. The thrush mirrors the grass, and thus they are one of the pairs that are not connected in a sentence; the other mirrors are the snake and the sun, and the tree and the dew. The thrush opposes the grass because it does not dwell in the grass; it flies. The snake, which is described as “dark” and “shadow-like,” opposes the sun, which is bright and life-giving. The tree opposes the dew, because the dew is bright and wet and new with the morning, while the tree is old, dead, and dry.

Of course, this is only a translation. This particular object-poem, generally called The Mother-Thrush, is one of the best-preserved examples from the ancient times. Because it is a translation, and not only a translation from one language into another, but from one type of language into another, we can be sure that the poem has not the same effect on us that it would in its original reading. Yet it is still evidence of the sense of physical beauty that the harbingers, the beetle-people, felt for the world, especially the natural world. It is a good example of the syxtte form and style: being simple to understand, but not lacking in meaning; containing three “character”-objects and three “mere”-objects (in this poem, the tree, which changes, is considered a character, and the grass, which does not, is considered a mere object). While the objects are not used in any particular pattern, it is worth noting that in the original language, the rules are not always so strict about where you begin and where you end as they are in ours; the grammar of any old syxtte is usually courtesy of the translator.

The Mother-Thrush is a well-known syxtte, but one that is far more well known, and the subject of far more controversy, is one referred to as The Rose. There were three copies of the poem, originally, but all of them were lost many years ago, presumed to be stolen during the cataclysmic wars of the Wasted Era. Since then, the poem has been given an almost legendary status, often called the most beautiful poem ever written, and men have searched to far lands to find an original copy of it. Of course, copies and translations turn up which claim to be the original; some even are almost as old as The Rose surely is, and written by, if not the beetle-people, their descendants. While it’s known for a fact that one of the six objects of the poem is a rose, the other five are open to debate. Some of the more popular candidates are a honeybee, a sword, a stone, a garden, a wall, and the sky; and so on. Among modern poets it is something of a ritual that each will, at some point, compose his own version of The Rose, so that the single poem (which probably is in fact lost forever) has become its own genre. The Myriad Roses, a rare book written decades ago, contains about fifteen hundred variations, from almost as many authors.

In talking with me and seeing my interests, Matthias kindly showed me to their collection of journals and histories—not dull, lifeless histories as told by the generals of armies, but histories by the exchanging of stories and the passing down of old memories. I had not realized, but there are story-tellers who devote their entire time to nothing but the finding and the preserving of tales, even if they must travel to far lands, risking their lives all the while. Some of these story-tellers I could recognize by name: Haust, Gruccio, and Gerard. Some were new to me: Chavan, Deamia, and Decimus.

Decimus was the name on the first book that Matthias handed me, and it was the one I felt compelled to read the most. At one point I stretched stiff limbs to see that it had grown dark enough that reading could only be done by the light of a lamp, and furthermore that a lamp had been placed next to my elbow without my notice. But it really is fascinating stuff. Decimus writes of legends, but with more detail than I have seen in other books, treating each one even as though it were an account of actual events. In fact he even says that he suspects nearly all of the tales he recounts to be at least partially true, at least descended from real happenings. Where his stories become more poetic and fantastic in nature, he admits it is likely that only some of the names and exchanges of power are the true elements, and that the descriptions of battles—complete with duels that last days, armies crumbling before individuals, speeches which seem a bit rehearsed for being thought up on the spot, and one story in which the armies are about to engage each other when a mysterious object falls out of the sky, tells everyone present that the two opposing generals are really brothers who are only using their armies to continue an old feud, and then falls back into the sky—these descriptions, the author admits, are likely metaphorical at best. Still, he spares no words in recording them as completely as possible. It is the battles he has the most to say about (the older one gets with tales, the more they consist mostly of battles), and he also takes a special interest in the history of the weapons used which, I admit, appeals to the more boyish aspect of my wonder. His interest is likely more than boyish, however, as it is clear from the writing that he is an expert at some aspect of weaponry, either the creation or the usage thereof.

It's getting very late now, and the lamplight is tiresome to my eyes. Normally I wouldn't write much at this hour, but I knew if I didn't write about the library now then I probably never would. But, to bed now.

* July 6th; Loiter

I was almost certain I had lost the ability to sleep in late. Not that I get the chance—life on the road is not quite luxurious—but I've been waking with the sun for so long it seemed a done thing to me that the thing would go on waking me for the rest of my natural life. Yet when I woke today I saw that the sun was already well on its way through the sky. Specifically I was woken because Gaunt threw an apple at my head, which is the sort of rousing I haven't gotten from him for years, not since a time when I could still call myself a new aspect of this army. It  made me feel young again, in that I felt ridiculous. The feeling didn't last, though, and no matter who's reading this, I hope you're not too jaded to have noticed why: apples! If being taken care of by my Sergeant made me feel young, apples made me feel absolutely childish. I can barely remember the home I left, but the taste of apples practically haunts me. They don't grow well on this continent, and when they do, the groves are jealously guarded.

So today I had apples, two of them. Red, not like the ones back home, but inside the same. Gaunt just gave them to me, without asking for money, which means someone gave them to him. He's not greedy, but he's not generous either, and he doesn't give away anything that cost him money. Normally I'd guess the city or its people gave us some apples as a gift—that sort of thing happens now and then—but I'm certain this city doesn't like us that much. If it were any other city we'd have to watch for fights. In Bagel some of our men were hurt and one was killed (I never got his name) in a tavern brawl, and then there was that wretched mess in Tercrest when we were jumped by ten men in the middle of the night. Granted, ten men aren't much of a match for four hundred, but I still wake in the middle of the night reaching for my sword because of that one. Up all night in the dark and confusion, men shouting and swinging lanterns at each other, not knowing whether it was ten men or a thousand, nor whether they had come from outside or from under the floorboards. We lost three there, I think, or maybe four, and one was that boy William who joined with us a week earlier in the same city. He took a sword in the stomach and didn't die until two nights later. The men who jumped us were part of a cult, practically. They had an insane desire to kill the Captain, thought he was Remmond's instrument or something.

But as I say, not in Loiter. This place is full of artists about to the bursting point, and the worst fiend here would have nothing to fear but slander and biting satire in the broadsides []. In the long run I suppose those things can get you killed (I recall the story of the man who angers a bard and finds a year later that no inn will take him), but it's all in the fur of being an army. I mean to say, it's not much use turning the public against something the public already hates.

Reason enough to stay in bed, perhaps? Frankly, I suspect this city's personality has gotten into me a bit. It's more like Westliffe, now that I think of it, than anywhere else I've been. The days are long, the temperature doesn't change and every spot looks good to sleep in. I had my late breakfast and found I had nothing else to do. The higher-ups are busy with the regular things and I suppose there's entertainment enough here, but none of it really seems worth going outside for. I've seen plays, and I find them frivolous. The artisan crafts are interesting but only if you have someone to show them to you, someone who cares not only about the craft but about you. Aside from these higher artistic endeavours, the city's entertainments are the same as any other's, just more expensive. If I am being entirely truthful, I imagine I will find myself alone at the library once more.

As it is, here I am. I only started writing because I had nothing else to do, nor any desire to do it. I didn't want to write, either, in fact the prospect struck me as about the last thing I wanted to do. But I try to make my journals good by my own standards at least, and one thing I've learned about writing is that the very time when you feel you can't write at all is the very time when it is most important to. And now that I've gotten to a point where I feel I can, I feel I've earned the right to stop. Or maybe not. Whatever. I'm going for a walk.
