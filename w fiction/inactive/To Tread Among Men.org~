** Chapter one: Lycaon's Youngest Son

Birthed from the warm iron of a shapeless factory into the wet snow of a shapeless Winter night was the sullen figure of a man beset with demons. His name was Nikolai (though he was called other things during his life) and his demons were two: first, that Darwin, his friend, his good friend, had come into the factory with him, but would not leave it. They had parted ways in the factory, which was very large, as they knew the danger stalking them and wished to play the odds that at least one of them would survive. And so one of them had. Darwin was the stronger of the two of them, and the more resourceful. Darwin was the better man. Yet Darwin was dead, dead, dead; and there was no doubt about that. Nikolai had not seen the thing happen but he had heard a scream which he was sure could mean nothing else. That scream, that yelp, like the sound a big dog might make if you crushed its head in a vice, coming from the throat of the man who had stood next to him at his wedding, that scream would not leave Nikolai, would never leave him, he knew [this passage must be fixed on two counts].

If his first demon had been transformed by the lens of this world into the death of his nearest friend, the second one had taken a less circuitous route; large it was, muscular and clawed. It seemed nothing less than a monster pulled from the very gates of Hell to torment him. Indeed it was certainly the root of all evil in the new life that Nikolai found was his own, the life that began with his transition into the snow. For after it killed his friend it had longed for his blood as well, and come after him. Actually, he had killed it - the small knife kept in his inside pocket finding use for the first time - but what did that matter? There is no triumph in the death of a foe that has already lost its life, and there is no repair for some injuries. The diseased arm may be cut off, but that is not a victory over disease, only a lesser defeat.

For Nikolai it was not hypothetical. He had suffered both the lesser and the greater defeats. His arm really had been cut off - his right arm, midway between the shoulder and the elbow. It was another thing he left in the factory.

Nikolai found that he had come out a back exit of the factory, and stood at the bottom of a long stone staircase cut into the earth. He knew the top would give him the street, but the snow was so thick and the darkness so impenetrable that he could not see the top. Thus, when he reached his left arm across his body to grip the hand-rail and took his first step, it was the first step of an uphill journey which apparently had no end. There was a heaviness in his feet; they did not want to leave the ground, they nearly cried out in their longing to be beneath it. In his head was a pounding so acute Nikolai felt he could discern individual blood vessels. His chest, tired, protested against the ascent. His eyes, dry, protested. And the monster - standing before him, blocking his path, looking down on him from a great height - the monster, too, protested.

In the absence of hope and light, Nikolai clutched logic to his breast. Some things were alive and some things were dead and even a werewolf could not survive such a fall as he had seen this one suffer. Its head was crushed into a shape almost unrecognizable, and its right arm was simply gone, as his. Some things were dead, and this was one of them.

"Move aside," said Nikolai. His breath was less, and his throat drier, than he expected, and the words sounded weak and childish. Coughing, he said again, "Move aside!" and accomplished the sound of a child shouting.

The monster considered him, or seemed to. Its one eye (for the other, even were it present, would be hidden entirely by the swelling from its wound) looked Nikolai over. It was an accusatory gaze. It struck through to Nikolai's mouth, which became dry; it seemed to say, "You have no weapon. Your knife put out one of my eyes, but you have nothing to put out the other." It struck through to the back of Nikolai's neck, whose hair stiffened; it seemed to say, "Your friend could not resist me. You shall not resist me." Then the monster opened its mouth, and its true voice struck through to Nikolai's heart, whose beating faltered. The monster said, "Not for the likes of you."

Nikolai lunged forward and swung at the monster, his hand passing through air. He slipped, and clutched the hand-rail again to keep from falling. Still the monster stood in front of him. Carefully, Nikolai lowed one knee to the wet stair, released the hand-rail, and thrust his left hand forward again. It entered the space where the monster stood without touching it. The snow, too - though Nikolai could not see well - the snow seemed not to settle on the monster's shoulders, nor in its fur.

"Phantasm," said Nikolai.

"A dream, more-like," said the thing. "But did you not know? You have left the waking world behind. I have dragged you into my domain."

The wind picked up, and the falling snow, swept by the wind around Nikolai and through the monster, described spirals and vortices in the air. Nikolai's knee rested yet on the stair, and he dropped his eyes from the horrible image that stood before him. But as he turned his head and looked around, he seemed caught in something like a vision, for the stairs and the railing and the factory behind him were gone, and he saw himself and the monster atop a high pillar amidst an endless black void; and in that other place he felt a great weight of time, and it seemed to him that in a moment the monster would fall upon him and devour him forever.

But the cold bit at him, and woke him from his vision, and though the monster had not left, Nikolai saw again the solidity of the world around him. The knee of his pants was wet where it rested on the stone stair, and there was sweat turning cold on his forehead. Nikolai put his left hand on the railing and it stuck slightly. He had lost his glove. He forced himself to stand, though it made him feel sick.

"You hold no sway over me," he said slowly and after some thought. He turned his eyes once more to the monster. He found that with effort he could continue to look at it. It said nothing, so he continued. "Dream, are you? What power does a dream have over the dreamer?"

The werewolf seemed to be smiling - if such a thing could smile. "Power enough to appear before you when you latch your door and shut your eyes."

There was temptation to test these words [There was temptation in these words], and Nikolai fought to keep his eyes open. If this dark creature had come to test him by strength, he would have long resigned himself to defeat, for he was wearied beyond words, and reckoned from his blood loss that he would be dead soon. But on this hopeless night, even resignation was denied him; for he felt that the thing in front of him, were it even a mere dream, had by the throat a part of him more dear than his dying [broken?] body. He understood neither the shape nor species of his peril, but felt instinctively the magnitude of it [, and it pressed [hard] at the very core of his being]. Lacking understanding, it seemed to Nikolai that at the very least, it was better to die with quiet grace than diminish to nothing, drowning in ever higher waves of panic and dismay. It is, he thought, better to fight. He swallowed.

"[Yet] the dreamer awakens at the end of the night," he said.

The monster's eye gleamed like a satellite in a cloudless sky. "And your friend, when shall his night end? I that bit you was once a man. When will his?"

The mention of Darwin made Nikolai's own eyes sting. He dropped his gaze from the monster and said, "Yes, he's dead. I know he's dead. I know you killed him."

The wind moved though the space between Nikolai and the monster with a sound that suggested the earth itself labored in its breath. He kept his eyes down for a time. Against his will, the thought of Darwin filled his mind, and he was unable to check his tears.

Though Nikolai held on to logic, he began to find that the loss of one of his hands had lessened considerably the strength of his grip. From his remaining hand the sensation of the steel railing was fading, to be replaced by a pain in each of the joints of his fingers. He knew that numbness was forthcoming, and did not know if he wanted it. The child within him rose up, irrepressible, huge, and it said, "I don't want you here."

The werewolf began to laugh. The sound was like thunder, and shocked the air in the same way[, and Nikolai trembled to hear it]. "Go away!" he persisted. "I don't want you. You've already hurt me so much. I gave you my arm." The anger of futility burned then in Nikolai's chest and moved him to look again at the monster and shout, "I gave you my arm! You have taken what you've claimed. Leave! I must be content with what you have left me of my body - and so must you. Go away! Go away."

The laughter ceased and the werwolf thrust out its clawed hand and seized Nikolai's throat, and Nikolai cried out [/aloud] [in spite of himself], for the claws were sharp, and they burned. "I am not content with swine!" said the werewolf. "I am not content with arms! I am not content with body and blood! Only let me drink of your soul."

The werewolf stood, then; for although Nikolai had taken it to be standing, it had been stooped on its knees; but now it rested its enormous feet on the ground, and stretched out its long and powerful legs; and, holding Nikolai aloft, it rose to a terrible height, and its eye flared [became very bright], and its mouth slowly opened, and in the blackness of its mouth could be seen the movement of inumerable snakes and flies and eyeless maggots; and Nikolai stood in the awe of the certainty of death [? perhaps, and Nikolai was struck dumb ... by the vision of death ... the certainty of death].

But [yet] the wind roared, and it seemed that the burning eye of the werewolf was smothered in snow; and with a pained thrashing like animal pulled underwater, the image of the dread beast was removed from Nikolai's sight, and he stood alone on the stone steps, and a distant voice shouted his name.

Nikolai stood for a moment quite still, transfixed and trembling. His left hand still clutched the handrail, and was entirely numb now. But the sweat on his brow compelled Nikolai to stoop and press his forehead against one of the steps above him, and he felt the coolness of the snow. Then he stood again and, his mind overcome by the simplicity of exhaustion, tried to walk up the stone steps. He found that he could. Moving his eyes from his feet to his hand in succession, he slowly climbed the remainder of the stairs, taking care to move his hand up the railing before each step. He thought he heard his name shouted again, but the sound was very remote. At the street at the top of the stairs, Nikolai released the handrail and fell to one knee, clutching his right shoulder. The fury of the storm seemed to be spent, or else was less here than on the ageless stair, and the night was growing calm and peaceful, though still very cold. Nikolai could see an ancient tenement house across the street, and small shops and stalls beside it, lit weakly by streetlamps, and he could make out the outline of buildings further on. Here and there Nikolai saw people moving along the street, unaware of him. Again he heard his name, closer now, and in response he said as loudly as he could, "I'm here!"

After about a minute, a figure, a man, detached himself from the shadows of a nearby building and ran to Nikolai. He slipped slightly but regained his balance and reached Nikolai, whereupon[?] he went quickly to his knees, grasping Nikolai around the middle and shaking him roughly. Then he put one hand behind Nikolai's head to hold it steady, and moved himself to face the Nikolai more directly. Nikolai was becoming more alert, and he was turning his eyes left and right, for it seemed to him that his name was still being shouted, and he was looking around for the person shouting it. "Where," he said, "where are you? Where are you?"

Nikolai saw the man's face move more in line with his own vision and he could see sweat on the man's nose, and the man's mouth opening and closing, though he could not connect this with anything in his mind. He saw the man as a wild animal, running and barking from blind excitement. The man's body was strange to him; his eyes had a feral look, and the arms that reached to clutch his own body looked stretched and wrong. The one on his side ended in something that might have been a hand. Nikolai doubted that a hand ought to look that way. While he watched, the hands produced a length of cord and bound it tight around Nikolai's bleeding arm.

"Nikolai," said the strange man.

Nikolai focused directly on the man, and as he did, the myriad shapes resolved, and Nikolai saw that he was a young man, and a man he knew.

"Randolf?" said Nikolai.

"Yes, yes, it's me. What happened? Where's Darwin?"

Nikolai turned his gaze downward, and only Randolf's grasp prevented him from falling.

"Was it the police, Nikolai? Did they kill him? Is he dead?"

"There were no police. Yes, he's dead."

"No police? Are you sure? How did he die?"*

"They've loosed a werewolf in the place."

Randolf stared at Nikolai for a moment, then straightened and looked at the factory. Then he tried to pull Nikolai to his feet.

"It's dead," said Nikolai.

"Are you sure?" said Randolf, still pulling at Nikolai. "Did you see it?"

"Yes. I killed it. Give me a moment."

"There's no time. There may be more of them."

"They only sent one."

Randolf shook his head vigorously. "They have not [do not have] the means to send any."

"Then the devil sent only one! Give me a moment. Please, let me stay here for just a moment."

Randolf let go of Nikolai and stood upright, clenching his fists and staring at the factory. "We may have only minutes. If we can get to Keane's - or even to my house - we will have a better chance of avoiding their searchings."

"Nothing else is searching. Nothing for miles. Randolf, there was only one. Listen. We came in through the northern breach. Darwin had information it would be empty. It was. No police, no soldiers. No one at all.

...

“Can you walk?” said Randolf.

“Yes.” Nikolai wiped his face with his sleeve.

“Do you need any help?”

“No.” He put his weight on his legs and stumbled, and Randolf held him under his left shoulder and helped him walk.

...

Like a soldier who forced to march for days, Nikolai slept while they walked; while Randolf carried him. His dreams were dark and formless and without meaning. He woke and slept freely, unable to tell the black shapes of his sleeping mind from the black shapes of the ghostly buildings, just visible through the Winter night. He felt the vague pressure of Randolf’s shoulder against his own side, which had only started to go numb with cold, and Nikolai was seized with the belief that nothing but this was real, nothing but he and his stark companion, walking from a place that did not exist to a place that would never exist, and at every moment passing through a new sea of unmeaning shapes in the snow. The snow itself was eternal; the heavens gave it up at no loss and the ground consumed it with an appetite never sated. He felt that black had more shades than any color, and that he saw them all that night. In his most lucid moments, he felt the snow crunch dryly beneath his shoes and could make out the shapes of street lights and the edges of buildings. In his most dreamlike moments, he saw only the most basic shapes, his eyes trained to see crude paintings where they looked upon reality.

Whether Nikolai’s consciousness wholly faded he could not determine; during the walk the walls of black that barred his vision closed in upon him, and when they had been lifted, he was lying in a room of absolute white. Randolf was at his side, looking away. His coat was dirty and heavy with melted snow. Young though he was, he stood very still and very solemnly, and he had the look of a warrior-angel, or one of the legendary Knights.

As Nikolai lay, he became aware that he was not dressed in his own clothes; what he wore was white and soft, and though it was thin, he was not cold. He did not feel his arm, but his eyes stung with that pain which makes one realize that one is alive - but Nikolai was not sure. He tried to speak to Randolf, to ask him, but he found that he could not move.

Randolf turned, and saw that Nikolai was awake. He leaned down to speak quietly.

“It’s alright, Nikolai. We’re safe now.”

Nikolai tried to say, “Are we dead?” but his mouth was weak, and he did not know how much Randolf heard.

Randolf’s face changed, and in a voice not his own he said, “You will never die.”

An intense, burning fear arose in Nikolai’s chest, and he strained to look at Randolf’s face, to tell whether it was Randolf who had spoken or someone else, but his own body was idle to his commands. Gradually the fear subsided, and after another long period Randolf said something and moved away from his field of vision. When he returned, he bent close to Nikolai and said,

“We can’t replace your arm. We don't have time. They’re giving you a fake.”

Nikolai nodded, or thought he did, and he closed his eyes again. When he opened them he was lying in the same place, but the lights felt dimmer and he felt as though he might not immediately fall asleep again.

Randolf was still there, slouched in a chair and reading from the gently-illuminated screen of a book. Nikolai found that he could not move any part of his body below the neck, though he strained.

Randolf looked up. “You awake again?”

“Yeah,” said Nikolai. “I can’t move. Why can’t I move?”

“They paralyzed you for the operation. You wouldn’t stop struggling. They said they can take it off whenever you’ve calmed.”

“I’ve calmed. Take it off.” Nikolai shook his head, and saw that his right shoulder was connected to something smooth and gray. It was thicker at the top, but

** notes and lines

(While the shock still hid the pain from him, he had used his belt to bind what remained as well as he could.)

Nikolai could not remember at first who the man was or how to speak to him, so great was his absence from the world of humans.

"I could not remember at first who he was..."

It is as your great pretender has said: my ways are not your ways.

I know the world better than you do. I have lingered longer. Which of us was cast out of Paradise first?

I have lingered longer in this world than you have. I know it better. Which of us was cast out of Paradise first?

The old legends say the shapeshifters come out under the full moon. The new legends say there are no shapeshifters. You have seen that both legends are false.

Markku: There's only me.

** plot sketching

Somehow Darwin and Nikolai are alerted to, and retrieve, an item which is Markku's signaler. Perhaps they take it from the "real" rebels, the ones who wish to destabalize the country? Anyway, upon realizing that it's signalling (after Nikolai takes it to the bar or wherever), they vacate the bar and enclose the device in a nullifying box. But Markku has detected the signal, so she quickly puts on civilian clothing and goes to Kean's public house. She asks for her contact, "Malcolm" or whoever. She is insistent, and agitated. Before Nikolai and the others slip out, they see policemen entering the bar. The policemen are actually there because they're investigating on behalf of Kellan, who knows that something is up because his werewolf went missing (why did they get sent to that particular bar? Either he had some idea of where Nikolai went, or he just sent people to every bar. Probably the latter.) The policemen are distracted by the sight of Markku, who is their chief or captain or whatever. Nikolai et al thinks they're distracted by seeing a lawbreaker, and they quickly sneak out before finding out what happens next. Markku assumes that she was insufficiently careful in asking for Malcolm (she knows that the police were sent everywhere - she knows they didn't follow her), and assumes further that Malcolm saw the police, and thought that she (Markku) was trying to trick and catch him. Because of this, she spends the remainder of her offscreen time trying to fix things with Malcolm, or with the Rebels, or whatever.

Markku has friends within the police, or at least, there are people she wants kept alive. Her bead is unique to her. Other policemen of similar rank (a very few) have beads with the same information, but she is unwilling or unable to steal them. Markku was going to entrust her bead to her contact with the other country (or rebels?). She does not have the means of copying it - or, she does not trust anyone but her contact with it. So, when she learns from Nioklai that her contact is dead, and that he is sort of a rebel, sort of affiliated with them, she gives it to him, either (if she cannot copy it) so that someone will have it, or (if she has been reluctant to give it to any), in the realization that she has wasted too much time. It has all the names on it, but is more important for the other military-type information it carries. After looking through it, Nikolai gives it to Randolf.

Nikolai knows, because of his pre-novel mission with Darwin through the Northern breach, that the man who is Markku's contact, is dead.
