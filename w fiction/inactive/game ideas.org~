* sinking ship

Single life (or... lineage? Vengeance?)
-non arbitrary ending
Soft time limit
Many decisions
Light bluffing, skill, traps
Multiple valid strategies
Secret and public class options
Rewarding cooperation
Separate verb and wincon
Non killing (except at end?
Non-martial setting?
Guaranteed (not necessarily frequent or regular) respites
The ability to meaningfully change the landscape, distinctively and/or constructively
Not sure about NPCs
Not exclusively interplayer interaction, but don't let there be a lack
Player-chosen wincons < randomly assigned wincons < disparate wincons, musical chairs (not enough for everyone)

What is an understandable (but not necessarily realistic) physical competition that's neither martial not sport?

Game - single screen, many rooms. Little workers and machines. Things go wrong. Water leaks. Flammable burn. Round things roll. Maybe critters escape. Flammable gas? You have to fix stuff. Downfall falling stuff. Rhythm. Spelunking planning. Start with shit graphics. Repair button, but also manually rewire, manually plug leaks. Not just one repair button forever. Pick up and drop would be essential. Little to no violent verbs available to player. Let's just say none. No fighting.

-One guy starts gaining power, but eventually will go rogue and kill you.
-Everyone remembers things differently. The overlap in their memories is what's correct.
-Basic insanity.
-Hallucinations.
-Maybe two guys carry gun, two guys carry ammo? Something like that.
-Your guy can be possessed, or become an ear for the enemy; they know what he knows. Best not to let him know much. Very best to do this without him knowing you're doing this.
-Siren song - earplugs?
-Fear


Probably can't do real-time; probably better to do simultaneous turns.
All actions can be performed one of three ways: Normally, Covertly, Aggressively
Not only can you perform any action in any way, but also...
...anyone else can perform any action in any way
...you can ask, tell, or command anyone else to perform any action in any way (and you can tell them Normall, Covertly, or Aggressively)
...you hint, tell, or warn someone that you are going to perform a certain action.
...You can also hint, tell, or warn someone something about someone else. E.g.,
...You can hint to Sally that Jack stole the gun from Matthew.
ALSO, you can use a time-modifier. So...
...You can WARN Sally that Jack WILL steal her knife.
...You can TELL Jack that, when you get more than one bottle of water, you will give him one bottle of water. AYE?
Predictions and information etc. have a huge effect on X's trust of you when the discover that you were lying/telling the truth.

INTUITIVE characters are more likely to believe suggestions, and doubt warnings; LOGICAL, PATIENT characters are the opposite.

If you give a character information, a number of factors determine to what extent they believe you. They may...
-Believe you unquestioningly
-Believe you, but try to confirm
-Be unsure, try to investigate on their own
-Be unsure, do nothing
-Not care
-Think you are lying, do any of the above
-Think you are lying, assume the opposite is true

If you tell a character to do something, they may...
-Do it
-Refuse
-Ask another character's advice
-Think about it first (SYSTEM TO DICTATE THIS?)

You can ask any character about any event, or about any other character. You can ask A's thoughts about B's opinion about C.
Such questions TAKE TIME, otherwise you'll just spend the whole game gathering information.

When you have a gun, you can point it at someone. Before or after pointing it at someone, you can
...fire, aiming to miss (frighten)
...fire, aiming to maim
...fire, aiming to kil

You can give items in the following way: offer, give, thrust
Or take: covertly, normally, aggressively
Or tell them to give the item to you.
So you could DEMAND that they GIVE you a gun, or you could ASK them to OFFER you a gun, etc.
Perhaps you could ask them to do this... in the future? Or if a certain state occurs?
If Jacob goes crazy, then do this. Etc.

Yes, you can tell A to tell B to tell C to tell D to tell ... etc.


PASSIVE CHARACTER TRAITS:
Perception (clarity, etc)
Emotional intelligence
Patience
Strength
Confidence (in self)

ACTIVE CHARACTER TRAITS:
Health
Energy/stamina
Mood

CHARACTER-CHARACTER TRAITS:
Affection / hatred
Trust / distrust
Fear?

PERSONALITY TYPES:
Optimistic (high confidence, high patience, good stamina, very good mood, high affection and trust, low fear)
Pessimistic (high perception, opposite of above)
Logical (high perception, low emotional intelligence, tries to base trust on others' perception, not only low affection but low effect of affection, may not know how to deal with fear)
Emotional (opposite of above)

SOME COMBINATIONS?
If X has high affection and low trust for Y, X may try to protect Y, even against Y's wishes.
If X has high trust for Y, may trust Y's perception over own.
If X has low affection but high trust for Y, may not save Y (unless very logical), but my follow Y's instructions, or consider Y's information more accurate.

If a character presents information, the other characters accept it based on...
...their trust of that character...
...their trust of the other characters multiplied by those other characters' reactions to the first character.

If a character thinks or knows they are being lied to, they may try to investigate to find out exactly what parts of the information are false, and/or why the false information was given.

What can I do if an NPC asks the PC a question? "Why did you tell me Jack wanted my knife?"
E.g.,
PC [WARN] [SALLY] [NOW] [JACK] [WANTS] [SALLY'S] [KNIFE]
wants, doesn't want, thinks, suspects, knows...
Disconnect here; WANTS KNIFE? or WANTS TAKE KNIFE? or WANTS ASK FOR KNIFE?

There should be a WHY and a BECAUSE.

If A tells B something about C, the factors of both trusts and affections and fear, etc, will all come into play, and B may ask C about it, in varying terms.
Might outright say, "A told me this." Or suggest, "A might have told me this."
Might shyly say, "Did you do this?" or demand, "Did you do this?"
C could ask or demand, "Did [someone, anyone] tell you this?" or "Who told you this?" etc.

Chars can ask, "Do you fear A? Do you NOT FEAR A? Do you AFFECTION A? Etc."


AFFECTION from A to B causes A to want to be with B, or for A to want to preserve B's life and wishes.
TRUST from A to B causes A to accept B's information and orders, and be less afraid when B is the one protecting them


PASSIVE or UNFULFILLED orders/suggestions/requests from A to B remain visible in B's datasheet to A; can be cancelled, for some or no reason.

You can say that you are sorry for shit.
You can also say that you're sorry that X's intelligence is low. burrrrrn

You can say that something WILL happen, MIGHT happen, OUGHT to happen, or NOT any of those. Or that a particular character WANTS it to happen.


Characters get one ACTION point and one SPEAKING point per turn.
Can speak TO a particular character, can whisper or speak or shout, but other characters have potential to hear.

You can push characters out of the way of things, and in turn get the bullet/whatever they were about to get. Depending. Always depending...


If A saves B's life,
B gets permaboost to affection for A
B gets tempboost to trust for A
A gets tempboost to affection for B
A gets temp or perma buff to trust to B


There are levels of certainty, which can be asked about, informed, or be the basis of commands. E.g.,
You could command A to MAIM B if B tries to KILL C, but...
...you can tell A to only do so if they THINK B is trying to do that, are PRETTY SURE, or are POSITIVE.


MEMORY
All characters record all memories, all things they have experienced, to varying degrees of accuracy.
Accuracy degrades over time. Depending on personality, certainty may not.
When they become uncertain, they may ask other characters about what happened.



GEAR FOR FOUR PEOPLE?
Rations for four
One gun, maybe two to seven clips total
One to four knives
Two to four flashlights
One or two medical kits
Maybe a map, compass, or GPS

EXPLICIT WORLD-LAWS:
Illusions get more difficult to maintain the closer they get to 100%. Mental illusions, that is. Can't quite reach 100%.


Each character has two hands, twoish pockets, and can have a satchel of some kind. Items can be...
Very large (two-hand hold only)
Long (one-hand hold only)
Large (backpack or two hand only)
Medium (backpack or one hand only)
Small (one hand, pocket, or backpack only)
Tiny (little to no restriction; fit many in pocket; might be hard to find in backpack though)

Long and Large probably have same WEIGHT.











Support for repeating question, noting similarities and differences, not wanting to be tricked into changing answers, becoming interested in certain things.
Another trait: INTEREST, meaning, wanting to gain new information about, or confirm old information about, a think, person, activity, etc.

Positive reinforcement: whenever a person is made happy, their PR score for all of the associated things goes up minutely. E.g., they ask you a question, they get an answer they like, they get PR for you, asking questions, and the subject(s) of the discussion(s), as well as perhaps the place it all took place in, or the time of day, or whatever.

Charisma inspires trust, charm inspires affection; but there are people who mistrust charisma or are put off by charm.

NOTE... learn a little bit about human memory, so I can better simulate it.



a NPC being asked a question, might hit a certain level of resistance, as calculated... being asked the same question multiple times, especially by the same person, might increase or decrease that resistance. Also, they might ask, "Why are you asking that? You already know." on the basis of 1. comparing the new instance of the question to recent events, finding that it matches the previous instance of the same question, and 2. by imagining themselves in the PC's shoes, and knowing that the PC knows everything that the NPC has witnessed the PC finding out, including the answer to the questoin, or 2a. simply cataloging, in their info on the PC, everything that they know the PC knows, and how the PC knows it

NPCs can make assumptions about each other (and PC) by picturing what they would do... more intelligent find ways of incorporating known aspects of target's personality.
