Imposition is something like the divine power; it is the most fundamental force; the primordial force. It is more fundamental than the other fundamental forces, to the extent that they derive (possible wholly) from it. It is not wholly describable, but may be partially describable. It may be recursive, and in fact probably is (alternate theory: there exist an infinite number of hierarchical Impositional laws). It derives from creatures, or from minds, or from souls, or from thoughts; possibly any or multiple of these, multiplied by observation or causality or the speed of light or probability.
