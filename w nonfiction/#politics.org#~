* 2016 election eve
With election day looming tomorrow, I'd like to take a moment to offer the hand of solidarity to my fellow people who are completely uncertain about this election.

I often wish I had the certainty I see so frequently online.

I tried to investigate Trump's business acumen. My impression is that he's a very successful businessman - but that's just an impression. Some people say he's had loads of businesses go bankrupt. Others say that that's just the cost of starting lots of businesses. He's rich, right? But apparently he got all that money from his dad. How much money DID he get from his dad? And how much money does he have now? How much money would have have now if he'd taken all the money his dad gave him and, rather than start businesses, just put it all in the bank? I don't know.

What about Clinton and those emails? Did she really do something illegal? Or was it simply careless? 



Notes and reminders on the eve of election day:
1. Clinton is the favorite to win the Presidency, at about a 67 chance.
2. The Republicans are actually favored to retain control of the Senate, at 55%.
3. If you are voting for Evan McMullin (aka Hopeless Candidate #3), and your ballot has a separate spot for Vice President, make sure you write "Nathan Johnson" there.







This election has been a resounding mass of uncertainty for me.

I'm sufficiently utilitarian that I would gladly vote for Trump - or Clinton - if I was confident that one or the others's presidency offered a higher expected return (in terms of probability of innocent lives lost, dollars wasted, etc.). I'm not particularly fond of Clinton, and Trump is one of the most personally offensive public figures I've ever seen, but if I was confident about which one would, even inadvertently, do the most good, I would absolutely vote for them.

But I am not confident, not remotely. Despite watching and reading about this election more closely than any other election in my life, I feel profoundly unequipped to make an accurate assessment of almost any part of it. When I try to dig deeper into particular issues to find the truth, they only become more complex and uncertain. For instance, I tried to pin down whether Trump is, as his supporters claim, a good businessman. I've been under the impression that he is; but a lot of people point out that many of his businesses have failed. People respond to this and say that he's started so many businesses that it's no wonder some of them have failed - every entrepreneur fails a few times on their way to success. But maybe his "success" is due entirely to the loan he got from his father? But how much was that loan? And how much would it be worth if he had just invested it? For that matter, how much IS Trump worth? I am not certain of the answers to any of these questions.

Another example. Is Clinton's email server a crime for which any other citizen would be prosecuted and imprisoned? If so, why wasn't she prosecuted? Is it because of political corruption? Or has the FBI done its job correctly, and people are just blowing things out of proportion? Regardless, is it indicative of problems during a Presidential term? I heard somewhere that Clinton claimed some sort of memory loss when questioned about the emails, but that sounds kind of made up.

On abortion, the standard pro-Trump argument is that while Clinton is clearly pro-Choice, Trump is... unpredictable. Well, I suppose I can get behind that reasoning. After all, a public official's past actions are the most reliable predictor of their future actions, and Trump has never held a public office, so it's anyone's guess. Maybe he'll (try to) do what he's said he'll do. Maybe he'll do something completely different. Maybe he'll elect Republican-ish people to the Supreme Court. Maybe he'll elect his personal cronies. Maybe other Republicans will hold him accountable (is that a thing that can happen?).




My two biggest issues:
1. Preventing abortion
2. Avoiding major disasters (such as nuclear war)

Trump wins #1. Not because he's pro-life - I'd be pretty surprised if Trump were pro-life - but because he's so unpredictable, and Clinton is very predicatably pro-choice.

Clinton wins #2, again because of Trump's unpredictability.
