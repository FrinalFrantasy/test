* Catholic position on contraception
My interpretation:

Version 1
It is wrong to apply to any particular sexual act(s) any modification(s) which tends to reduce the probability of conception, unless said modification(s) is added with a purpose other than reducing the probability of conception, AND said modification(s) does not impede the sperm from entering the vagina in a manner and state consistent with conception

Version 2
It is wrong to apply to any particular sexual act(s) any modification(s) which reduces (and/or is done with the intention to reduce) the probability of conception when applied to sexual act(s) which could result in conception, unless said modification(s) is added with a purpose other than reducing the probability of conception, AND said modification(s) is done for a morally legitimate purpose, AND said modification(s) does not impede the sperm from entering the vagina in a manner and state consistent with conception.
