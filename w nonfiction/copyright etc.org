Ethically, when should copyright expire? Or profits? Author's death? Hard to say.
Honestly, I don't even really mind not being able to lend or sell. I can even live with not being able to bequeath. This idea that the book/license/whatever is sold entirely and specifically to ME... what I buy is a permanent membership to a club, and the copying/converting is just the logistics of how to get there. Yeah, it lacks some of the things "traditional" publishing has, but it has advantages, too.
    ...mostly work by redownloading or backing things up, with the honor system as a fallback. Yes, the honor system, because DRM has no effect. You can make something illegal, which will prevent from doing it the sort of people who do not do illegal things.

    Arguably a compromise between "traditional" publishing and the storytelling that came before it: storytelling was more about the performer, and there was no copyright. But the difference here is that in storytelling, copying/converting was tons of work; in publishing, copying/converting is some work; in digitial media, it's no work at all.

...publishing and digital also preserve authorship and exactness and authenticity, which I like... not perfectly, obviously, but orders of magnitude better than storytelling.
