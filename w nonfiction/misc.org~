* "Advent Conspiracy"
I found this post to be interesting, but suspected it needed more delicious numbers, so I dug some up.

I was curious about the $4.5^11 figure for Christmas spending by Americans. 

The $4.574^11 offered by the NRF is an estimation, in late 2006, of that year's holiday sales. A more concrete figure, $4.356^11, is given as 2005's holiday sales. What precisely is meant by "holiday sales" is unclear. The same list of information gives the average consumer's spending for the same holiday seasons as $791 and $738, respectively. Dividing the "holiday sales" figures by the "consumer spending" figures does not give a result anywhere near the then-U.S population (~2.956^8, According the [[http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&met_y=population&tdim=true&dl=en&hl=en&q=usa+population][U.S. Census Bureau]]). It gives us a number about two times too high. Therefore, if all these numbers are accurate, the term "holiday sales" is inclusive of significantly more than simply consumer spending (it is worth mentioning that "consumer spending" is also not defined). It is easy to imagine the large gray area of monetary expendetures that might or might not be factored into any of these figures, depending on your methodology.

Another straightforward way to find a "total consumer spending" figure (at this point I am going to assume "consumer spending" means individual spending on gifts, decorations, plane tickets, etc.) is to multiply the result from the latest Gallup [[http://www.gallup.com/poll/150203/Americans-Plan-Spend-Christmas-2011-2010.aspx][Christmas-gifts-spending poll]] ($712) and the latest U.S. Census Bureau population count (3.07^8). This renders a total figure of a little under $2.2^11, less than half of the first figure we had. Likely this figure could be rendered even smaller by the fact that the population count likely includes many non-spenders, such as infants. It is also possible that the $712 Gallup figure is too low, as the poll specifically says it's tracking spending on "Christmas gifts" (wihch implies it is not tracking such things as airfare for Christmas vacations/family reunions); however, given that the Gallup figure is very close to the previous figures we had for individual holiday spending (the historical figures on that poll's page indicate that our previous figures may have actually been too low), it is probably a good one.

The second statistic in the OP is that the lack of clean water kills more people every day than "almost anything else". I'd also like to see the sources for this, and exactly how many causes of death are linked directly to lack of clean waterÅ\but in the meantime, I suspect the statement is accurate, and that most people will not be interested in contesting it.

The third statistic is that the estimated cost of making clean water available to everyone on Earth is $2^10. I assume this figure comes from
